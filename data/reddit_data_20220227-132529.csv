0,RealDaveCorey,"Trying to straighten my leaning garage, was the roof installed entirely wrong?","Hi, I'm looking at torturing my leaning garage back into shape and adding some bracing and rafters to get it stable again. The garage is old but the foundation is pretty good and the roof and sides were replaced at some point. The front and back will be replaced after I straighten it because they are ruined by termites and somehow much older than the roof and sides. 

One of the sides is leaning out a couple degrees and the other is straight, but the whole building is also leaning towards the back. My question is, is the roof too narrow for the structure? Was it installed wrong? The 2x6s of the roof land only on their very ends on the header, and some are showing splitting. There are nails through those 2x6s into the header so I dont think the walls have pulled away from where they were originally attached? [Photos included.](https://imgur.com/a/u5J1dHF) 

Thanks so much for any advice that can be offered, I'm really trying to figure out if I can fix the garage without redoing the roof, because at that point there is so much work to be done I might as well tear it down and rebuild.",HomeImprovement,1645985955
1,ZeroCool1,Thoughts from two years into purchasing a fixer upper,"A few random thoughts after I've wrestled with a fixer upper with a lot of character over the past two years.  Its nearly a Ship of Theseus.  Maybe this helps some people.

*  When buying a house: floor plans are labor intensive to change.  If you have a load bearing wall its hard to remove it and put it elsewhere.  Everything should be considered changeable, except for the floor plan.  Think about how efficiently the space is used in the house, and if its not good: don't buy.

* Concrete slab foundations suck.  Floating floors aren't ideal.   If you have a bathroom in one, pray the pipes don't need to get accessed.  Having underside access to your house is huge.

* Stop being afraid.  Don't be afraid of drywall damage.  Rip the drywall down. What type of walls do you have: smooth, orange peel, knockdown?  Practice matching the texture and start opening up your walls and fixing.  Vancouver Carpenter has every niche situation dialed in, and you can use his videos as springboards.

* Buy the tools and don't improvise.  Get the good stuff.  Even if you think its a man baby purchase and you wont use it a lot.  I bought a router a few months ago for a one-off job.  I'm using it to solve all sorts of weird problems while re-doing trim.

* Think hard about what should be replaced and what should be rejuvenated.  Back to point #1: stop being afraid.

* The goal of taping and mudding is not to have a ""flat wall"" the goal is to make the speedbump created by embedding the tape so wide that it is not noticeable.  Took me way too long to figure this out.  

* Buy stainless steel drywall blades and buckets.

* If it looks good, it is good.  Period.  You are not machining a jet turbine blade, you are renovating a house.  Get things level, try to make things square, and things will follow from there.  Think about where someone will see the work you will do.  Is it only going to be viewable from some weird corner of the house?  It doesn't need to be absolutely perfect.    There's paint on the backside of my toilet.  I'm not pulling the toilet out to paint behind it.    Its literally impossible to see.  Stop wasting time making stuff look nice that nobody will ever see.  However, if your renovation is going to be viewable from a foot away:  Make it nice.

* Projects that are cosmetic can be done in as long as you want them to.  Pros charge by the hour.  You don't.  Take your time and you can do things better than the pro.  It may take you 10x the time of a pro, but you can do 2x better.  Seriously.  Cheap handy man aren't going to take the time to feather out a 3"" drywall patch to 2', but you can.

* Are you detail oriented or big picture oriented?  Find out in the beginning.  I am not patient enough to paint.  I don't like to mask, I don't like to move drop clothes, I am trying to move to fast.  Just because a project is ""easy"" doesn't mean its easy for you.  I contract out my paint now and sleep well.  However, I love to demo, pull wire, and frame.  All of these things (arguably on trim) are not very detail oriented, and all your fine details are going to get covered up by drywall. 

* Plan the order of operation on your projects on your house before you start.  On your first house, if you're like me, you will come in and paint first thing.  Wait until you check off the behind-the-drywall items before painting.  I've had very good experiences with touching up, but I've wasted so much time re-priming and re-painting in my house.  

* Pros in general, are adequate.  Unless you pay out the ass for a serious contractor, you are going to get fast paced work that is acceptable.  Nobody is going to take the extra time to make sure things are ""perfect"".  New windows?  The pro isn't going to match your trim.  Baseboard right next to the casing?  Most pros aren't going to do a return on the trim.  Learn how to DIY so you can specify the things that you want to the pro, or buy items before they arrive so they can use them during the process.  Use them for their labor, not for their big picture thoughts

* Think about how easy a renovation is to repair before settling on it.  Drywall and white trim are king because they are fixable.  Tongue and groove wooden planks and wood trim suck because they are labor intensive to fix, alter, or repair.",HomeImprovement,1645985873
2,gwenstellamade,HELP! Fireplace contractors screwed up the job,"So, I’m in a bit of a pickle with my current fireplace renovation work and would like ask everyone for some advice. Here are the things that have gone wrong:

* I picked out a brand and model of firebox and was told by the contractors that it would fit my current fireplace when they came to give a bid
* After demolition of my current fireplace, i was then informed the firebox would not fit
* At first they said the wall had to be brought out by 18”
* I had to go through the installation manual and work out the math with them (because it’s a corner installation) and it’s actually just 6”
* Reluctantly, I agreed for the wall to the moved 6” out
* But when they did the re-framing, they brought it out by 12”, citing wanting more clearance needed than what the installation manual stated for “safety reasons”. It was also not a very well-constructed frame. 
* In the meantime, they worked on the exterior of the chimney, left paint overspray on my metal roof and left the chimney with a tarp over because they did not order the cap until they started demo. Overall, the work seem rather shoddy.
* I asked for the tarp to be reinforced but was told it would be fine. It was not fine. There was a light rain yesterday and a rather significant amount of water dripped down from the chimney.

I could also go on to talk about how the owner was rude and disrespectful every time I raised a concern.. “Oh things go wrong with construction”.. You know the drill. 

So at this stage, I don’t think I can trust this company to work on my house anymore. I really want to just want to move on and get a different contractor that I can trust. But this company holds a significant deposit compared to the work done (and the work that needs to be re-done).

I am almost finished my basement rental suite project and I have one last issue to solve. The spot for the OTR microwave has a stud right in the middle and I want to install venting.

My living room has outlets on three different circuits including ""Living Room, Garage, and Furnace (yes, there are wall outlets that are on furnace breaker smh)"".

Sharpie the number of the breaker or the circuit name on the back of your switch/receptacle plates and you can avoid going through the ""Which one is this on again"" cycle when you go to replace or trouble shoot any electrical issues.  Many people already know this identification trick but I was surprised how many didn't when talking to coworkers.

Bonus tip: it can also be helpful to plug in a radio or vacuum that is on to identify the breaker if you are working a long ways away from the receptacle you are trying to identify, saves a lot of walking.

36,1cecream4breakfast,Can’t find stud for curtain rod,"https://imgur.com/a/TbNTQSB

Several months ago I hung a curtain rod over my sliding glass door. The rod had 3 brackets. I could only find one stud (far right bracket which is still attached in the picture). I had to use anchors for the other 2 brackets as I could find no studs. Over time the 2 brackets with anchors began to pull away from the wall. I took the rod down and the left and middle brackets. I removed the anchors where the middle bracket was and it created a hole, so I’m starting to patch that. Using a magnetic stud finder I cannot find ANY places directly above the door where the stud finder picks up any metal. Is that because the area directly above the door doesn’t *have* any studs, or because they are fastened differently and there isn’t a screw on the surface? After the patch job is done I don’t know where I can securely put the middle bracket. 

At the location of the far left bracket, I just pushed the anchors back in for now. As you can see, the stud finder is sticking to the wall pretty much directly below where the left bracket hung. I found 2 screws with the stud finder, aligned vertically, so that must be a stud. But…when I drill in near the anchors, trying several places an inch or so away from each other, it’s all drywall. No wood. Does the stud I thought I found “end” below the left bracket location?

If I ever build a house I’m putting curtain nailers (or whatever they’re called) above all windows and door walls! Hanging curtains is such an annoying task when the studs are in awkward places or, as is my case, you just can’t find them.

How can I find studs without drilling a hundred holes in my wall? I have a double rod (sheers against the glass, blackouts facing the room). 2 rods + several of each kind of curtain makes me not excited about trying even a heavy duty anchor. The curtains get opened and closed multiple times a day. They hang by curtain rings for aesthetic and length purposes. I’d prefer not to have to remove any curtains or go buy a single rod. I’m just trying to clean this mess up before I put the house on the market. Interior pics were taken months ago. So, where are my dang studs?

39,the_d33j,Switching from Polybutylene to PEX over time?,"Hi All,

First time homeowner with some DIY experience here.

I own a house in Kansas in an area where pretty much all houses that are the same age as mine were built using Polybutylene plumbing (i.e. pretty unavoidable). Within the next 1-1.5 years I would like to swap it out for PEX. The house is 2.5 bath with hot and cold manifolds for the Polyb and everything uses copper fittings. There's a total of 13 fixtures, and I would estimate that I would need to open up 3-4 walls and 1-2 ceilings to get to everything, but not 100% sure on that yet.

I've talked about it with some more experienced DIYers I know IRL, and their advice has all been along the lines of ""switch it over a bit at a time"". So, as I see it there's two options:

1. Take a week off of work and switch it all over at once (or at least as much as possible).
2. Run a new PEX manifold alongside the existing Polyb ones for a while and try to get the most used fixtures done first.

My concerns / questions with 2) are:

1. How would this gradual transition work in practice?

More details and image in post.,"I recently bought a house in the northern mountains of NJ. My home is a raised ranch on a somewhat downward incline (homes behind me are elevated, homes in front are below). There are many things wrong with it but my biggest concern right now is a water seepage issue in the sub basement. I noticed after moving in that the fake wood laminate in the laundry room was bubbly when you walked on it \[so I pulled at one of the corners and the whole thing came up\]([https://imgur.com/a/LQ98T74](https://imgur.com/a/LQ98T74)). The concrete underneath is clearly damp but it only affects a few spots. I figured I could just hire someone to seal it and redo the floors but I keep reading that concrete seal needs to be re-applied after a while.

The rest of the basement is tile but I have noticed slight dampness in the corners. I do have a groundwater/grading issue because there was a mini flood event on the back patio after a rapid snow melt off coupled with rain. I asked a plumber to come out and see about installing a sump pump but he said it was an issue with the land itself and to hire a landscaper.

65,GeefyGoofer,Help - Finishing My Staircase Repair,"I'm a new home-owner and not long after moving in I realized that my main staircase had 3 broken treads (cracks extending partially down the length of the board).

Over the holidays I removed the treads, glued them, braced them, and reinstalled them. This was also my first time working with paint removal as these treads had 5-6 layers of paint on them.

So... now I'm at a point where I need to finish things up. I was hoping that the wood would come out nice enough that I could stain them, but they have a lot of pits in them that are holding onto paint, so I'm thinking that is out and I'll just have to paint them.

I've only removed paint from 2.5 treads. Primarily out of laziness I'm starting to consider just painting over the existing paint for all of the other treads. I also removed some molding along the wall that was coming up and found there are fairly large gaps between the stairs and the wall, hence the molding that was covering it.

So my questions:

1. If I use wood filler to fill the pits in the wood, can this be stained?
2. Much of the paint has chips (or visible chips in lower layers that were painted over), what is a good way to still get a smooth finish and hide these chips without removing all of the paint?
3. Is it worth the time to remove the paint from the existing steps if I know I'm going to painting over them?
4. And recommendations in filling the gaps as opposed to covering them with molding again?

I'm in the process of renovating one of my rooms into a nursery. A year ago, my wife requested that the walls in said room be painted to a deep blue that you can see in the pictures above. A month ago, my wife requested that the walls be repainted.

Because the blue paint would likely be tough to paint over (and because there were numerous bumps, dents, and other imperfections on the wall) I decided to remove the paint and start from scratch.

I used a paint remover that I spread over the walls and then used a paint scraper to attempt the removal. The first wall went very well and I was able to scrape the two layers of paint cleanly without much damage to the drywall.

The remaining walls were a different story. I'm not sure why, but when I scraped off the paint it took off a thicker chunk and it seemed to remove some of the drywall/sheetrock (not sure what the difference is, or what exactly my walls are made of). I tried being more careful and using more paint remover, but I was unable to replicate the results from the first wall.

My questions are:

1. Can I just sand down the cardboard part, fill in the holes with a filler, and then apply a primer/paint? 
2. Do I need to apply a spackle to the cardboard area before painting?

I will continue to monitor over the next few months to see how the warmer weather impacts the readings, but my general question (anticipating that something needs to be done) is the following:

Would it be better to install a more powerful fan (which will, I believe require 6” piping), or install a second penetration elsewhere in the basement - or  both?  What questions should I be asking the original installer as the system is still under warranty?

We bought everything to blow-in Atticat fiberglass insulation ourselves because he has quite a bit of professional experience with it, but quickly ran into a problem he hadn’t encountered before - our attic is too small to install the baffles.

- It is about 2 feet tall at the center and quickly declines, so the closest he can physically get to the edge is about 6’ away (he’s 5’11 and 140lbs, so definitely thin enough to fit in most spaces)
- The house was built in the 70s and baffles weren’t installed previously so nothing is currently up there
- We can’t push the baffles through the soffit vents because the rafters run through the middle of each one, which cuts the space we have to slide the baffles through in half (so we have maybe 6” on either side of the rafter in each vent)

I have a wall switch controlling wall sconces in my bedroom, which has exposed joists under the ceiling, The scones do a terrible job lighting the room and I want to add new downlights and maybe a ceiling fan.   See \[image\]([https://imgur.com/a/9OsXUow](https://imgur.com/a/9OsXUow)).   Fastened atop the joists are two layers of 3/4"" plywood that make up the attic decking. I can't run wire on the attic decking,  because we use and access that space regularly for storage therefore (as I interpreted the NEC) wire would have to run wire in conduit that would be very inconvenient for the way we use the attic space (sliding around boxes and the like).

So please tell me if this idea makes sense, and is acceptable regarding electric code.   I want to lower the ceiling by 1.5"" to make a cavity that accommodates the wiring for the new loads. The plan:

\- Nail up a lattice of 2x2's at the ceiling, spaced 16"" apart, fastened into the exposed joists and into the attic decking from below.

\- Replace single gang box with triple gang to power new LEDs and new ceiling fan in addition to wall sconces that I will keep.

\- Run new romex wire from the box up the interior of the wall, out a small hole close to the ceiling. Drill holes where needed through the 2x2's to locations of new lights and fan.

\- Suspend new finished ceiling to the furring strips, avoiding the wires when using nails/fasteners.

In this plan, the wires will be protected on the attic side by  1.5"" plywood, and on the bedroom side by just under 1.5"" of the furring strips.

Do I need additional protection for the wiring, other than maybe metal plates on the furring faces? Are these metal plates even needed? Or maybe this is all insufficient and I should use armored cable?

Would you say this scheme meets normal practice, or is this something weird that an inspector would object to? I may or may not do the work myself but I do want to prepare a design that is acceptable for whichever route I go.

My background: I am comfortable with basic electrical wiring, but don't know the best practice for ceiling wiring. I am comfortable with power tools,  mechanical work, and fairly competent at making finished surfaces look good. Willing to open drywall as necessary because I plan to remove the 1980's wallpaper and refinish the walls anyway.

I want to really get this right.  I don't want just pressure balancing; I want a valve that is easy to use, where I can set the temperature and leave it, and it will maintain it at that temperature if at all possible, even in the face of the incoming water changing temperature.  I want one handle that just controls the temperature, and a separate one that turns it from off to low to high pressure.  I want quality that will outlive me and my children.

Windows are 20 year old medium quality vinyl double sliders. Home is from the 60s and I don’t think that exterior wall has insulation. The attic is above and also seems to propagate noise , and has maybe 4” of cellulose. My guess: A large portion of the noise is going through the window (sliders seem to be a bit leaky and it’s old) with some noise reduction style laminated dual pane with differing thickness window.

93,LordWeaseltown,Trying To Get A Rough Cost Estimate...,"Hi all! So, my brother and I just bought a house! 2 story, 2100 square feet, beautiful home but definitely needs a few things done. We are not handymen by any stretch and I wanted to get a rough sense of what kinds of costs I'm looking at for some of the work we plan to get done in the home

The first thing we need done is to knock down a wall. Our home is a four bed, 3 bath. My brother has claimed the downstairs room, but wants to expand it by knocking down the wall dividing his room from the dining room. We don't think it's load bearing, but we could be wrong. We want to knock that wall, which is basically just drywall, down, and install a new wall 2 to 3 feet deeper into the dining room space.

The second thing we need done is to rip up the upstairs carpet and replace it with laminate hard floors. There is a master bedroom, a hallway, and two other standard sized bedrooms about 12x12 that need to have all the carpet ripped out and replaced. 

The last thing we need is some electrician work. We want to get a chimebox installed and some doorbell wiring set up, since our home has no doorbell or even the wiring for one, and we want to install a video doorbell. There are two places in the home that need new outlets installed in them. Finally, we need the electrician to run wire and install a few outlets in the new wall I mentioned earlier

I know there are a ton of variables that come with that kind of work that depend on the home, but I was wondering if those who are a bit more practiced with getting these things done have a rough idea so we know what to prioritize and budget for",HomeImprovement,1645942314

105,diy-goonery,Is it necessary/useful to seal/treat pressure treated fence posts?,"At the end of this November (just before the ground froze), we had about a 1 acre fence (\~700 linear feet) built on our yard. (photos here: [https://imgur.com/a/4xRPWg8](https://imgur.com/a/4xRPWg8)) The style is 4'' pressure treated posts that were pounded into the ground. It was a pretty decent investment (\~$6k), but we're very happy with it and want it to last.

In order to get all the posts the same height (some end up higher than others due to small terrain differences, rocks in ground , etc), when they were done, they took a chainsaw and shaved the top of all the posts at the level of the horizontal rail. They did a good job making sure the tops are slanted so they will shed water, but it obviously exposes the non-pressure treated core. I asked the installer if they recommend sealing the tops, and he said most people don't do that, and we should probably expect about 15 years of life from the fence.

Would it be a waste of time to take a bucket of sealant and just brush some over the tops in the spring time? Obviously part of the post is in the ground itself (that bottoms were chamfered into points and were pressure treated), and if that will be the first part to fail regardless of what we do on the tops, not sure if its worth it, given the endless list of both interior and exterior projects we have on our queue.

Quick backstory: I was away from home for about a week while staying at my dad's to help him after surgery. When I came back, the whole place smelled like stagnant water. Isolated the issue to the kitchen sink. Did some googling, found advice saying to pour hydrogen peroxide down the sink. Did this and opened the windows all day. Smell lessoned but there was still the faint smell of stagnant water still. Tried the hydrogen peroxide trick a couple more times over a couple days, smell remained. Googled again and found an article recommending pouring baking soda and vinegar down the drain. Seemed sus, but found similar articles saying the same thing.  
Poured baking soda and vinegar down the drain. Flushed with hot water few minutes later, seemed to have done the trick.  
6 hours later I hear a small explosion in the bathroom. The toilet lid is ajar and the water is running full on. I shut the water off, drain the tank and search the trailer for any signs of water damage. Haven't found any yet. Turn the toilet back on, it's running more than it should but the thing has always been wonky, but does eventually stop running on it's own.

As a growing community we find ourselves having to limit the posts that may be off-topic to the primary purpose of the sub of 1) home improvement questions and 2) sharing of completed projects. These topics include home warranty companies, household tips, general painting advice, room layouts, or rants about companies, contractors, and previous owners. While these may be of interest, we are trying hard to provide a venue that will both allow, and constrain, the conversation. Again, the main goal here is to help homeowners with their homes.

It's covered by an old, ugly brass square frame with bi-fold doors. We ordered this replacement from Lowes, but the doors swing into the interior of the frame when opened, which doesn't work. They are cabinet style doors, so where the hinge is mounted makes the outer edge swing into the fireplace itself by a few inches.

The other issue is, because the brick is arched at the top, the old frame was able to have the mounting screws hang diagonally and grip onto the bottom of the curve. These new doors are designed to mount inside a square opening and be inset into the fireplace, so you can't actually attach the mounting screws with tension along the curve. Hopefully that makes sense. Any recommendations? I believe we'll need bifold doors that don't swing in, but I can't find anything that will mount below the arch. The vertical opening below the arch is only 20 1/2 inches high, but the top of the arch opening is 28"" high. The frame we have now is 32 inches tall and covers the majority of the arch (which is fine, I prefer the square doors).

128,Kuzball_A,Can I finish my basement if the ceilings are lower than the property maintenance code allows?,"Our newly purchased house has a basement in prime condition to finish, but the ceiling is low — about 6’1 at the bottom of the joists, which are exposed. I’m 5’9 and my wife is 5’6, and our son is 6 months old, so we feel pretty comfortable moving around in there. I’d like to have it partially finished to serve as a playroom, but my local property maintenance code reads thusly: 

“PM-404.5 Minimum ceiling heights: Habitable spaces, hallways, corridors, laundry areas, bathrooms, toilet rooms and kitchens shall have a clear ceiling height of not less than seven feet (2134 mm). Exceptions: … 4. Basement rooms in one- and two-family dwellings occupied exclusively for laundry, study or recreation purposes, having a ceiling height of not less than six feet eight inches (2033 mm) with not less than six feet four inches (1932 mm) of clear height under beams, girders, ducts and similar obstructions.”

130,Sofiwyn,Advice wanted - trying to decrease neighbor foot vibrations and noise,"TLDR: what is the best way to not hear or feel neighbors kids' heavy footsteps? 

We have a shared wall with neighbors who have some rather active kids. They like to run around and surprisingly have very heavy footsteps. Idk if they're playing DDR, but it sounds like it. 

It's rather annoying, their footsteps are heavy and sound like thuds and I swear I feel like the wall/floor vibrates a little from it. I have no idea how their downstairs neighbor bears this. 

I have talked to the neighbor about this and they told their kids to stop that one time, but I'm not a fan of doing this every day, plus I think I'd be pretty unreasonable. The neighbors are also aware their kids are loud as they asked if their kids were being too loud when they opened the door, before I even said anything. In an ideal world I'd just buy the neighbors a large plush rug and ask if they wouldn't mind having their kids to play on that, but that's pretty damn weird. I'm certain the footstep thumping is exaggerated because they have a fairly empty room with hardwood. None of this information is really helpful though. 

However, I'd like to know what I can do in our condo. There are two rooms affected, one is my bedroom with hardwood that is fairly empty. I'm planning on buying a rug, adding some heavy curtains to my window, and trying out some acoustic panels to see if this does anything to reduce the footstep effect. 

The other is my roommate's bedroom. Her bedroom is carpeted and fully furnished. They footsteps aren't as loud in here, but they're still very present. This room is also closest to the neighbors' living room where the kids play. 

I have brown noise playing on a speaker constantly, and while it helps reduce the noise, I swear I can feel the vibration from their feet. It feels like my bed moves slightly. It's like a very minor earthquake tremor. 

What can I do to make it so I can't hear/feel the neighbor kids play DDR or whatever?

140,kiyaleesi,Help! Advice on wood or Vinyl plank flooring,"My partner and I have lived/owned our house for about 2-3 years. We had to do some foundation work about 6 months ago and pulled up the carpet the previous owners had installed. We were shocked to find wood floors underneath! We thought we struck gold and started removing the carpets only to find they had basically destroyed most of the flooring with water damage, paint and some sort of chalky adhesive. 

It’s nicer then the musty old carpet, but but tearing the carpet out we had committed to living with “trap house” wood floors until we could afford to fix the floors. We’ve lived with them awhile and are now in the position to change them but we aren’t sure what to do. 

So at first our idea was to try and restore the wood, but after thinking about it, we didn’t want to worry about any little scratches or splashes of water that might not get noticed until it’s too late. We have 2 small dogs as well and I’ve heard (from previous landlords) that dogs can destroy wood floors with their nails. 

Then we decided to go with floating Vinyl plank flooring on top of the wood, and if we want to restore the wood floors in 10 years we have the option. Then our flooring would be waterproof and scratch resistant and we wouldn’t have to worry, right? Well I’ve been looking at reviews for vinyl plank flooring from Homedepot and people are saying that they scratch really easy and potentially FALL APART(after only 6 months)! 

I am at a little bit of a loss as of right now. I really liked the idea of Vinyl plank flooring because of the supposed durability… but if they aren’t as durable as they claim do we just bite the bullet and attempt to restore the wood?  Is there a brand of vinyl plank flooring that actually holds up to the hype? 

Also a side note : my partner is extremely handy and would like us to do the majority of any labor if we can, that was another plus of the plank flooring… it’s supposed to be easy to install.

208,AbsolutelyPink,Fire-multi family complex advice needed,"TL;DR
Home fire in multi-unit condo and mine was damaged as well. What steps I need to take? What things should I consider? HOA involved as well as my own insurance and the responsible party possibly. What do I need to do? Contractor and rebuild info. ELI5 please.

So, I own a condo that I rent out. This is my first time as a landlord and I have had a property manager handling the renting and such. Recently, there was a fire that ended up damaging my unit. I'm insured, the HOA is insured, I'm unsure if the person responsible has insurance.

Anyway, a company was called out by the HOA to board up the units though mine has some roof and wall involvement leaving it exposed to the outside elements. I was told they needed the units looked at by a contractor and engineer, before the restoration company could further board up anything else or tarp the roof. I have asked the HOA if they authorized that and was told they don't know yet.

I have filed with my insurance the same day. I've provided them all the documents and info they've asked for thus far. HOA has their adjuster and a contractor out earlier this week (I wasn't present). My insurance hasn't sent anyone yet that I know of. I would suppose this is because the HOA is primary as far as the insurance matters go. 

So, what do I do? I took some pictures the day of the fire. Not nearly enough as we weren't prepared to be inside (masks, proper clothing, lighting) and it was dark. They have since boarded up the back and front to prevent unauthorized entry. I've had the property manager put a lock box on the door.

Someone suggested I find a contractor. I know the HOA has to rebuild the framing, roof, siding (the exterior) first and then the interior is done. At least to dry-in stage. I know this will likely take a number of months.

Is there anything else I should be doing? Should I be searching for contractors or just let my insurance find contractors? If I should be looking, what type of contractor am I looking for? I understand they'd be paid with a cash out from insurance, but what if the contractor runs over budget? 

Do I have more leeway with my own contractor (I'd like to add ac to the unit now that it's going to need a lot of work). How does the picking out of carpet, flooring, paint colors, et al go when it's mine vs. insurance chosen contractor or is there a difference? Do they have to follow current code and building requirements now vs when they were built in the 70s? For example, are drains required for 2nd floor washer pans now and water heater pans? Insulation upgrade requirements?

Are there things to consider adding that don't cost much, but can add value or convenience? Sound deadening sheetrock cost vs regular? Do I have a choice in that matter?

Are there things I need to remember to do? I upgraded the flooring, the heater is on the same wall as the fire as is the water heater and below where water has likely been dripping on it so, I plan to push for new units and upgraded flooring, washer/dryer was on the same wall and was covered with debris when I saw it. I had recently redone the countertops in the bathrooms and kitchen. Carpet in one room, sinks, backsplash. In addition, since there was water and debris inside, that was left as is. I am sure the water reached the cabinets and such by now. No power has left the fridge with food and no cooling. What to I ask to be replaced?

I asked my adjuster if I should call the restoration company in as well and he hasn't responded to that question. 

I'm frustrated just sitting here waiting for something to happen and wondering if there is something I can be doing in the meantime?

218,megmegamegan,Interior paint issue,"So we decided to paint our dinning room a warm sunny yellow, it was previously a light mint green(it was that way when we moved it). there had been a patch on the wall that we had believed the previous owners patched up due to it matching the height of the dining room chairs they left, from the chairs scraping against the wall well we sanded the area then painted, the new paint immediately bubbled out, whatever they had patched the spot with was silicone or another water resistant material based.

 So we had to scrape the wall in that spot, so now it is white underneath. We tried to paint over it on the first coat, I guess its was more of a spot coat to see how noticable the spot would be, and it's pretty bad. Significantly lighter than the rest of the wall.

 I'm not sure how to make the paint match. Is our only option to repair the walls white before painting over?  I already painted another two walls the yellow while my husband was scraping and sanding that spot. So I'd rather avoid having to paint white over the cover I already put and having to get more yellow and start over. 

We believe there is some of that light green paint left in our basement, would painting the white spot that with the green paint then growing over it with the yellow help it all match up? I have no idea how old it is but I'm willing to chance it. I'm not very experienced in this sort of thing.

220,Interplanet123,Moderately interesting gutter / sump pump tale...,"This tale may help others, who knows.  Also looking for feedback about whether my logic is  sound, or not.

Lived in our house for just over a year.  For the first 10 months the sump pump never cycled.  Dry pit, no action.  For the last few months it has become very active.  So I got right into it.... Determined the water was coming in through the inlet pipes and not the discharge pipe/pump itself.  Determined (via a dye test) it was not the same water constantly being spit out and then draining back down again.

Shrugged and chalked it up to high water table this time of year and maybe I just didn't notice at this time last year.  Pump was doing its job, basement was dry.  Could be worse.

One day I took a walk around the house while it was pouring.  My front downspout connects to a 4"" round PVC pipe that goes underground and away from my foundation.  However I noticed water was spurting out horizontally from a couple of pinholes near the bottom of the downspout.  That's odd.  Further, a small drain grate that shows the inside of the 4"" underground pipe -- further downstream -- showed very little water moving through, despite it sounding like Niagara Falls coming down the downspout.

The next morning I decided to dig things up and investigate the junction where the downspout meets up with the 4"" underground pipe.  After removing the piece of downspout, here's what I saw:

https://imgur.com/a/dJ3pOvs

While that may look like mud / mulch, it's actually a black sponge (that is in fact saturated with mud / mulch).  Whoever designed this system deliberately left a gap of about 1"" between the bottom of the downspout, and the 4"" underground pipe.  In this gap they put a piece of sponge (sponge specifically designed for eavestroughs), presumably to catch debris before it goes underground:

https://imgur.com/a/1xOWgwA

However the unintended consequence is that as debris builds up against the sponge -- as well as inside of it -- less and less water goes through to the actual pipe underground.  And as a result, follows path of least resistance which happens to be (I'm assuming) out of the 1"" gap, under my front porch, to my front foundation, to the underground weeping tile, to the sump pit, where it is ejected out, farther downstream from the grate I mentioned earlier.  Sooo.... it takes the long way.

Here is what the bottom of the downspout looked like, where it was meeting that sponge:

https://imgur.com/a/a3EHsRm

I've decided to remove the sponge, and I bought a longer downspout piece so it now extends an inch into the pipe below, rather than stopping an inch above it:

https://imgur.com/a/PgvfrC1

The downside is there is no longer a filter to catch the mud before it goes underground.  However the mud blockage was ""only"" an inch deep, which isn't horrible considering who knows how long it took to accumulate.  We have gutter guards as well, and will be proactive about gutter cleaning.

The upside : my hope is this returns things to a point where the sump pump is no longer cycling, or at least, not very often.  I don't know yet if that will happen, it hasn't rained since.  Fingers crossed tho.  Also hoping that not too much damage has been caused to my foundation during the past few months that it's been that way.

There are only a handful of them that have broken off, and from a functionality standpoint it's not an issue for me as I'm still able to load dishes just fine, but after realizing it's exposed rust I was just wondering whether that could be posing a health risk. I don't know if the water could pick up particles of the rust and be spreading it around to my dishes or if I'm being a hypochondriac. I've been using it for 3 years like this and (knock on wood) haven't had any issues so far, but just wanted to get input here.

[https://old.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/t11o7c/under_contract_on_a_house_from_1964_sellers_home/]

Some updates:
1. No, we didn't ask the sellers for more money. They are our friends and we got the house from them over better offers. Me even suggesting we might ask for some help with repairs in that thread was just an early morning stream of conscious and one possibility on my list of options. It was *never* seriously considered beyond some passing thoughts...my friendship with them is too valuable. (And you rightly excoriated me for even listing the idea.)  

2. After so many of you said ""Ummm...cloth wiring is fine, someone is smoking crack"" I went back to my insurance agent and said as much.  She said ""Well, it is a combo of things as things are strange in Florida right now...it could also have been just the age of the house that some of the other carriers didn't want to participate but they did mention the wiring too.""  Um...gee thanks lady. You sent me in a panic that the house was virtually uninsurable solely because of the ""cloth wiring"" noted on the inspector report.  WTF. Turns out is is Romex (a term I just learned because of y'all!), so it would be fine. 

3. Ultimately though, this all was was good because we knew nothing about power, and we got the electrician in the house to check everything out. The home only has the original 125 coming into it and that is too little for the house and new appliances, sound system, fish tank and other things we want. We could move into it just fine as is--like the contract stated--but we would start to blow the system pretty quickly even with new appliances the electrician said.  (The heat is oil based and even moving to a new AC unit with heat wouldn't be handled by the current power. Another electrician confirmed this over the phone too.) 

4.  You guys rightly said ""Dude, this money is nothing on a good house deal for the long term....just buy it and do it!""  And we agree. The house has a great location and checks a ton of boxes....so we are just going to do the electrical upgrade with the box, more power, outlets spaced to code etc. We are awaiting a bid form the electrician but this guy is a trusted source so I think we will be fine.

297,bobadefender,"Shower leak, remove preslope?","Background: 
I moved into a home built in 2012 in November 2021. I was taking a shower 3 weeks ago when I noticed the drain was clogged and the water was building up in the tiled shower (about 2 inches high) but it never went over the curb. Ceiling downstairs started leaking. I immediately emptied out the water from the shower floor with a bucket. The leaking stopped soon after. I noticed some missing and cracked grout in the corners. I also unclogged the drain from all the debris. This is the first time the shower clogs and leaks since I moved in.  I haven’t used the shower in 3 weeks since the leak.

I had 4 plumbers come in and they all said they think the shower pan is faulty. The demo was done today but the contractor couldn’t find any holes or cuts in the shower pan liner. He said the shower and shower pan liner actually look in really good condition. The red flag he found was a lot of rust along the interior side of the shower curb.  Now, the tile guy is saying the preslope is in good condition and he doesn’t want to demo that. There is a big obvious crack running across the preslope that meets with the drain. The area where the crack meets the drain is darker with some minimal mold. Should the preslope be demoed to investigate the condition of whatever’s below? How else would one explain the leak if the shower pan is intact?

301,funcabbage,Blistering primer and scraping issues,"I need some advice on a painting issue.

Here’s the background: we started prepping a room in our 1933 house for painting. The previous paint job (sky blue) was clearly terrible and we could see splotches where patching may have been done. We patched new cracks, sanded them, spot-primed, washed the walls, and then primed everything. We noticed that the paint was bubbling as we did the first coat of primer, but only on certain spots in the room. We scraped away the bubbles after the first coat of primer and primed again. After the second coat, the bubbles were even worse. We started scraping them again and suddenly, our layers of primer, joint compound, and the blue paint started flaking off, leaving old patches (and then some) visible.

As for environmental fixes, we turned off the humidifier on the furnace and started using a small dehumidifier in the room. The temperature is \~65 degrees F.

Has anyone else experienced this before? How did you remedy it? Our current plan is to joint compound over the newly scraped areas to flatten them out, sand, spot prime, clean, and begin priming again, but maybe there’s a better way. 

Another question: when scraping, initially it comes up easily but eventually it becomes harder to scrape layers off. Does that mean I’m at a point where I don’t need to scrape anymore?

Thanks in advance for your help!

I’ve noticed the recirculating kitchen exhaust has been dripping grease, so I took out the filter. At first I assumed it was the kind you’re supposed to wash by hand since it’s a single piece, not something that can be opened to get at a charcoal filter, but the mesh is a little broken on one side and I noticed a thick mat of black is between the two pieces of metal mesh ( [picture](https://imgur.com/a/EB7av3c)).

I did try to clean it but it just keeps leeching grease, so I’m assuming it’s a charcoal filter in the middle and there’s no way to clean it — are these kinds of integrated filter grates cheap and easy to replace? A quick Google search has only been showing me charcoal filters that are meant to go into a set of grates that can be opened, but not a long integrated grays like this.

2) no gutter system in place for most the house so the water has no place to run off properly and it builds up in the corner, they talked about making a ""french drain""? 

3) possible rodents, mice or squirrels or something but he didn't actually see any, just the droppings, and a couple acorns or nuts inside the furnace area. 

4) frozen shut off valve for cold water, and valve missing from under sink in a bathroom.

My partner and I just purchased a home built in 1900 that was unfortunately not maintained. We knew this going in and were and still are fine with the long term fixes we need to do. 

it's just comical: like there aren't any baseboards on the first floor. In the kitchen they screwed two by fours against the wall (I'll add pics via imgur tomorrow when there's better light) and they didnt even caulk it or anything they just screwed 4-6 screws along the wall ??? 

 in the living room there are gaps between the floor and the wall where you can see the basement light shining.( I will get photos of this to see where this hole is down there now that my partner is off and can help)


Basically if there was a cheap fix they did it and it's going to be a long process and I'm reaching out for more experienced minds to guide my process here.

Today I cleaned the air ducts with my shop vac because  there was four inches of dirt and garbage debris in the vents. I ended up finding all sorts of stuff down but it was mostly big plastic bags, cigar wrappers, a couple joints, and wads of plastic.

While I was cleaning these I found 2 pieces of duct work that had holes in them and at the very least needed inspected or replaced. One was so brittle it just broke when the shop vac was sucking things out so I would personally rather shell out the cash and replace that and have piece of mind tbh.


During my air duct cleaning I noticed the carpet was loose around the vents and I wasn't very surprised to find that the entire livingroom carpet is not secured to the floor. We are going to leave this down until after painting 🤣

These are our major inside notices that we need help narrowing down the most pressing to focus the money on;

1. Air duct spot replacements

2. Kitchen cabinets- upon cleaning them we found they were heavily infested with mold not mildew. We are getting a consult but worst case scenario may be to just gut the whole kitchen space. We don't have any appliances in right now so there's room to move things around

3. Bad laminate wood. It's everywhere and it's not secured and it isn't cut to fit. I'm not a picky person and I have lived in  rough apartments and duplexes my life without fuss aesthetics aren't a problem.

 The backstory here is the homeowner didn't fix any of the actual problems we asked them to fix he just put down laminate floors and then delayed our closing which I had to pay for. So the guys a jerk and I'm judging him and his shitty laminate job for it.

The laminate downstairs is peeling up off the ground already and is bubbling up in places. We do not know the condition of the wood underneath entirely. My partner mentioned some concern about a gummy or tacky substance. We took a peak under one corner and what we saw looked like decent wood under there so we have some hope.

4. Baseboards- this is self explanatory but it also may help with any rodent activity that is happening because number 5 is....

5. Finding and plugging all the holes and crevices I don't expect us to find them all but we want to at least get the ones covered that should be. Like pipes from the toilet to the basement- there shouldn't be a hole there in the floor I'm pretty sure that's supposed to be flush to the floor.

6. I have a whole wall that is packed with BB gun holes just everywhere on the inside livingroom wall. It must've been a party place or something

7. The ceiling has gaps between the molding and the ceiling. I'm not sure if this is a problem but I'm sus on the ceiling in the livingroom and it's more than because it's popcorn, I promise. It's popcorn and it's multiple patch colors of popcorn everywhere 

Tomorrow I'm going in with the idea of just shop vaccing the basement so I can breathe easier down there. Then probably move on to the BB gun wall until the sander arrives and I can get to work on the kitchen wood paneling.


But we need to know where to focus our money at

1. Air ducts
2.kitchen cabinets
3 baseboards 
4 all the holes that need filled
5. The ceiling 
6. Wood floors

Egads that was a long one. Thanks for hanging in there with me and let me know what you think the smartest option to tackle first would be.

361,crikfromcincy,Help with new fence,"We had five companies come out to quote us on a remove/replace for our existing fence that was falling apart. Based on reviews and Fri Ed/family feedback we went with a company that was on the higher end of our quotes. 250 feet with two 5’ man gates and a 10’ double gate in cedar with pt pine stringers and posts. Total cost $11,000.

When the crew arrived they immediately started pushing back on every single thing that I had negotiated with the sales rep including moving things from our fence line (bad shoulder and couldn’t move some lumber/firewood), the direction of gate swings, and a lot more. Most of that was resolved, but required me to talk with them no less than 20 times (they kept ringing my doorbell to tell me why they couldn’t do something).

What was supposed to be a two day job has taken 5. Stuff happens, I get it… but when they would finish each day I would walk the job and voice my concerns. Every time they’d tell me why they couldn’t do something or why it’d look awful. When the sales rep called to followup I told him what was going on and he assured me that they wouldn’t get paid until I loved my new fence. He sent their manager over and I talked with him about my concerns… which just made the crew mad as they brought up how their manager was called no less than a half dozen times. 

I tried to extend an olive brandy by buying them pizza on their last day and telling them repeatedly that I wasn’t trying to talk bad about them, but this is a significant expense and we want a great, top tier fence, not a budget job to save money- so whatever it costs, let’s just do it right.

Upon walking the job this morning I am completely deflated. There’s cuts on the bottom of the fence that look jagged (they said they don’t remove the old posts and concrete, they just cut them low and stomp them down - but clearly they didn’t and cut the fence to navigate around it). The fences don’t swing the way I had asked (said due to slant). There’s a slant… which makes no sense because they built the fence 4” off the ground d elsewhere but it’s on the ground and slanted in the above picture where I believe it could have been a little higher, but level. The hinge is only attached by two bolts and the third is just sticking up in the air, there’s a gigantic gap in one gate that was supposedly necessary, but not present on the other two gates at all, the locks/handles for the gates are all facing out (not in, where I would be), they moved firewood that was stacked and covered but tossed them into a pile and left to put in the rain (tarp is wadded up and covered in snow now)…. And more, but I’m so upset I can’t get my marbles together to think of it.

And that’s just what I (an inexperienced person) can see. Am I overreacting? Am I expecting too much? What are the right words/terminology to say to them to address my concerns? I want to be respectful but firm. I don’t feel like I got what we agreed to and I voiced my concerns all along the way, being told I wouldn’t pay until I’m happy but when I brought up what would make me happy (what we agreed upon before we signed the contract), I was told why that wasn’t possible over and over and over, and now I don’t feel like I’m getting what we agreed to.",HomeImprovement,1645831676

Through research I’ve found it’s called a mortise lock.

Now the main wire to my unit is pretty busted, but I am curious if it's likely the electronics inside will still function correctly? I'm especially curious about this one as the unit was fairly expensive.

There is about an inch of usable wire till that I could probably strip and try again, but I am worried that this might ultimately just be way too short, any thoughts?

Lastly, I was worried that wire connectors may have failed, either due to my inexperience or due to them being two decades old. If one came loose during my attempted install could this have caused the sparks?

Is this worth another go? or simply too dangerous?

I won't name them as I'm trying to give them an opportunity to make it right and I still have some doors with them. 

Meanwhile, I'm looking at plan B, let's say Window World, who has installers on staff. 

So two separate business models. I had tried Lowe's and home Depot but all their installers quit. Then I tried another installer and he refused because I have a 1932 stone cape cod. The current installer is the only one who has seemed confident in installing, and he has done one door. The door looks great but he damaged a stone to one side and was supposed to come out today and repair it, and install another door. This is after a long series of screw ups from both the salesman and the manufacturer and the installer. Suffice to say, I was piping hot today and everyone involved now knows it. Also circled in my SIL who works for a design firm that uses said company and they know she is pissed as well.  They do have another installer affiliated with them that I have now called and am waiting for a call back. 

So, while I see if they can make this right, I have a free consult scheduled with window world in a week. 

What are the pros and cons of the two business models for the consumer? I would assume someone who has their own business separate from the salesman would be able to make a better living, and if they mess up too many jobs, said company would stop the affiliation and no longer recommend them.

My sump pump check valve makes a bizarre bouncing sound when it closes sometimes.  Please have a quick look at this video with sound on:

https://imgur.com/a/QtTgA6K

- I don't want a silent check valve, the sound doesn't bother us and I like knowing when the pump cycles

- just wondering if this is ""bad"", or fine.  It doesn't always do this, sometimes just one clunk and it's done

- I don't have a weep hole drilled into the discharge pipe in the pit.  The reason is because (other than this sound) the pump seems to be doing its job, so why mess with it.

- however if drilling the weep hole will stop the bouncing without any adverse effect, I'll do it

391,bun-dance-of-caution,Building permit required for small DIY project?,"General question about when a building permit is needed for a small DIY home improvement project.  Briefly, I’d like to re-configure how the wooden steps are situated from my house down into the garage.  The current garage door steps onto a landing approx 4ft 8in above the garage floor, then 7 steps lead down along the back wall of the garage.  This layout limits the depth of the garage and prevents pulling larger vehicle into garage.  I’d like to remove the steps, extend the landing about 2 feet to the side wall of the garage, extending the landing (with 2 additional legs), and reposition the steps going directly out along a side wall of garage.  I’ll also need to rebuild the rails on the steps and landing.  No electrical or plumbing, and minimal cost involved as most lumber is in great shape and will be reused.

I understand that permitting requirements differ across jurisdictions, and county inspection office may provide best guidance.  I’ve tried contacting my inspections office but no luck speaking with a person thus far.

393,wedonelost,"Damaged pool/deck, total loss, insurance denied. Advice/Options, please?","Hi all! Sorry for the long post.  Hopefully this is a good place for this.  My backyard is unfortunately now an improvement project.  I have an above ground pool and a section of the wall and railing was damaged in a storm last year by a partially fallen tree.  It is a very old pool so there are no replacement parts and I have called more than 10 pool companies in my state and all said repairing is not an option, therefore a total loss. Insurance denied coverage(even longer story), I have fought with them for months.  Now, I'm out of options to my knowledge, other than lawyering up.  Multiple quotes to replace it are in the $12000-$15000 range.  I am completely fine not having a pool anymore so replacing it is literally the last thing I'd do.

Here's the options I'm thinking of.   I would like to possibly, make a little money from it still.  I feel like it does still have some value.  The pumps and all of that are in fine condition, so maybe a handy person could make use of it?

1. List it on craigslist like sites for sale really cheap, maybe $500-$1000? Maybe that's too low? Not sure really.  They would just need to take it all out themselves.  Then I'd probably have to pay someone to remove all the sand and other debris left over to then lay sod. Maybe I am too hopeful for this option?
2. Bulldoze it out and lay sod.  I have a guy who has all the equipment to completely remove the pool and deck to the dirt.  He does tree work and I've used him for a few years now.  I imagine based on his other work, it should be no more than $2000 (just for the removal).
3. I haven't found one yet but surely there is a metal working type handyman that would be able to repair the pool wall.  Not really what type person I would look more when searching, but a cheap repair could cause me to keep the pool.

What else could I do that I am not thinking of?  Thank you all for you help, I really appreciate it!  One good I suppose is this happened during a federally declared major winter storm so I am getting a tax break to help cover some expenses.",HomeImprovement,1645819841

**However, my electrician says that I cannot have a 200A sub-panel fed off a 200A main, and that the sub-panel would need to be 125A. Is this true? If so, then what is the purpose of pass-through lugs? Could this be a local/California thing?**

To be clear, the meter+main would be a factory-bonded service panel (I'm not sure what the correct terminology is) containing only 2-pole breakers &gt;=30A. The 200A downstream load center would be the only ""lighting and appliance"" panel.

However, with this new one, the vent fan turns on instantly when I try to heat anything, which is very loud. It's like it does the normal microwave sound/running + the vent on high anytime I run it, without pressing the vent button. This isn't how the same model worked that I have used prior. It normally just sounds like a standard microwave heating, and then if I hit the vent button, it will then turn on those extra fans get that loud, but not by default.

I looked around and found no way in settings/options for this particular model to turn off the vent mode. I am wondering if this is a faulty new unit?

437,fantasyidiot1040,Question about backer board in shower where pan extends up the wall,"Hi all,  
  
I am renovating a shower, and looking for some advice on installing wallboard correctly. Here's what I'm working with: https://imgur.com/a/Woalk8y  
  
The shower pan's mortar seems to extend about 4"" up the wall, which I haven't seen done before. The previous install had the backer board installed above and BEHIND this edge and first row of tiles, which seems like a really bad design to me, as it created a ledge for water to run over before draining. That said, there doesn't seem to be much/any water damage to the plate and studs, and I estimate this shower to be about 20-30 years old.  
  
My current plan is to NOT demo the shower pan but just re-tile it. It looks totally solid, no cracks, and passed a flood test during inspection two years ago, so I think I'm justified in not tearing it out.  
  
I would like to shim out the studs so that when I put new backer board on, it is flush with the vertical portion of the shower pan, creating a seamless wall finish. My instinct is to apply appropriate backer board, then mud seams and waterproof before tiling. Just wondering if anyone sees any issues with this.",HomeImprovement,1645807820

440,NomadJago,Bay Window leaking water help!," 

My bay window is leaking serious ice/snow melt water to the inside of the window. It had been a few drops here and there constantly from a seam along the top inside trim which I stopped with duct tape (visible in photo). I woke up this morning see a puddle of water, maybe 1-2 cups of water, on the inside ledge of the window and put down towels to soak that up. What can i do? What can i do to buy time until ice and snow is gone from the roof and the bay window? I am up in northern MN and temperatures are subzero to teens above zero making this really hard to deal with, stressful, in the cold of winter. I am so disparaged. Am I looking at $3000 to have a new bay window put in come spring/summer (still 2-3 months way easily)?

What complicates this is that one of the crank out windows does not close completely, as show in the photos, so I have a black trash bag tapes around that window pane on the inside, and I tried caulking the seam on the outside since it does close completely. I don't know if this related though, as the photos show some serious ice damns where the bay window 'roof' meets the bay window itself.

- The section were the closet is located is above the garage, there does not appear to be any support beams in the garage under the closet area. 
- Above the closet the attic truss beams run perpendicular to the closet doors but parallel to the main wall.

We ripped out a very-old cabinet in the basement to replace it with a workbench/tool storage area and we exposed what appears to be mold growing on the cinderblock wall. (Pictures #1 &amp; #2). The white stuff is efflorescence but closer to the floor the discoloration I believe is mold. We've only lived here for 6 weeks but we had a small amount of water leak in from the rear wall on a particularly warm day where a foot of snow melted and it rained all day (same wall where the mold is.)

We have a dehumidifier running 24/7. As soon as it warms up I'm going to repoint the downspouts away from the house and evaluate regrading away from the house. I also need to clean out the gutters as I don't think the previous owner cleaned them prior to listing/selling the house.

My question is for the basement. We are going to take a stab at killing the mold ourselves, but what do I need to do to re-seal the basement? There is a small gap between the cinderblock walls and the concrete floors (Picture #3). Is this normal? Is this where water might have seeped in? What's the best way to seal it up?

It looks like a previous owner tried patching it at parts by sticking a small piece of wood and adding concrete over it, but they didn't go all the way around the edge of the basement as the gap exists in several sections. The walls have been painted and plastered (or sealed?) in most other spots... what are the chances I have mold in other spots underneath the paint? Or would the mold have grown on top of the paint?

All of the windows in my apartment get very humid because the building is very old. I know it's cold outside, warm inside, condensation bla bla and I do everything right, airing out and not drying clothes indoors etc. Just can't remove this problem whatsoever (unless you have a good tip). So fungus grows (not blackmold, had it tested) in the sides of the window sill.

My bedroom window and kitchen window is placed on the side of the building where there is never sun. So those windows are especially bad. I had the window in my bedroom changed for one that would isolate better and also had some kind of plates installed in the bedroom so the wall/windowsill would be less cold/moist. The painter (hired by my landlord) just removed the old fungus and painted over everything after doing those things. 

But of course the paint just won't dry. It's been over a month since he was here and it's still not dry. And fungus is growing again. The paint in the ""top""/ceiling of the window is just falling off in flakes and the paint in the sides of the window sill is completely wet and running. 

I dry all the windows with towels 2 times a day, I air out and I have the heat on.

Not a single conflict in the 3 years I've lived here, or in the past decade, according to other neighbors. However, they have quite a few structures on their property that are not permitted; most of which have been there 20 years or longer. A few trailers, RVs, porch awnings, etc.

Someone bought up a number of vacant lots in the neighborhood (we suspect to build rental properties) and decided that their ***first step*** was to call Code Enforcement on the club. 

Code Enforcement gave them a dozen citations, and 6 weeks to get compliant, or $1000 daily fines will begin. The Club is complying and removing all of their structures. 

However, the Code Enforcement Officers decided to a clean sweep of the entire neighborhood while they were here. They knocked on several doors, citing people for improperly placed trash cans, un-permitted railings on porches, canopy tents in people's backyards, and a variety of other ""violations"" that seem quite ridiculous, given the context of the neighborhood. Code Enforcement has not been in this neighborhood in decades, according to neighbors who've lived here since the 1980s.

Keep in mind; no one who ***lives*** in this neighborhood actually called code enforcement.  Code Enforcement explicitly told us that the only complaint they have was filed against the Bike Club, and it was not by a resident of the neighborhood. 

This feels a lot like an overreach on their part, as the entire community is content with the bike club. I've spoken to every neighbor on my street, and none of them are happy that Code Enforcement is here. 

With that said, is there anything can be done about this?

We are replacing 22 windows in our 100+ year old home in Massachusetts outside of Boston. We are also replacing a French patio door with a slider. Window sizes are mostly 30-35 x 60-65 (with slight variations between certain windows, but most of them fall in this range). There will be 3 casement windows (no larger than 36 x 36) and one picture window that will replace an existing triple window in the front of the home. 

The project was quoted at $105k 😱 without any discounts. Once he plugged in the “discounts” and current promos available, it went down to $74k. I had estimated $46k (honestly hoping it would be less) on the high range, and my husband guessed $60k. 

The windows in the quote are Anderson’s proprietary Fibrex composite material, double hung, dual toned frames (white inside, black outside), a single line fractional grille on the top pane only (embedded inside of the glass panes), and their “TruScene” insect screen.

Is this quote normal/reasonable/fair for what I’ve described we are getting - or are we being totally duped? This is our first quote. 

We *don’t* want wood (no maintenance please), we *don’t* want vinyl (sorry but can’t put vinyl windows in my 100+ year old house) and he kind of talked us out of fiberglass (good salesman) during the quote (the flaking and need to still refinish over the years).

One of which is this large and featureless garage facing the street. What are some things I could do to make this space look less awkward?

Since this was captured, even the small tree is gone.

Everything from the door, and to the right as well as up to the roof, is the garage. Everything to the left is the master bath, and could someday get a window.

Some ideas I've had are:

- Add in a window (real or fake) above the garage door
- Hang a giant fake wreath or similar
- Keep it totally blank and host neighborhood movie nights with a projector

486,kak0w,Basement Spalling Repair (Waterproofing),"Home Built in 1960, Northeast Pennsylvania. Cinderblock basement walls, with 40% of basement finished.

Walls appear to have been dry-locked, and then repaired and dry locked again on the bottom two feet.    
Pictures show spalling in two different corners of the unfinished section. 

In 2020, 3 months after moving in we did have water in some parts due to heavy rains/flooding. Gutters were set up going directly into the ground run off pipes. I have since cut them away and have them 4+ feet from the house because I feared they were the issue. 1.5 years later, plenty of Rain/Snow melt, no evidence of water in the basement at all.

**Question is:** Should I (DIY or Hire) and repair the spalling and repaint that area and see how things are over the next 2-3 years, or based on the spalling shown, is hydrostatic water a concern and should I have a french drain installed into a new sump pump and then repair the walls? 

We can not grade the house anymore due to the build design, the ground is very close to the house already, but in general it is very flat overall and slightly sloped away for the most part. 

Pictures below show spalling in one corner, and spalling damage near sump pump area. Thanks!!

488,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"Under contract on a house from 1964, seller's home inspector missed cloth wiring a year ago when they bought it, ours found it. Is it worth the 25-30k it will probably cost, or should we pass on the home?","Sooo yeah. My husband and I found the perfect home for us: Our friends partially restored a one story 1964 mid-century modern, about 1800 sqaure feet, 5 minutes from our current too-small-2005-towome-in-a-hot-area. They bought it a year ago intended to stay forever but he got a job transfer unexpectedly they can't say no to, in a state they want to be in so they are having to move.    


The house has great bones, it's totally charming, we beat out 12 other offers on the home--our friends were selling it and turned down offers of 20k more than we offered to give it to us-- but our inspector noted cloth wiring and now of course we can't get great insurance, plus it is simply unsafe. (Friends bought the home a year ago from original owner, and they redid the kitchen, opened up a wall etc.  We love the place. Either they had a crappy home inspector, or my friends did enough renovations in the kitchen to make the wire problem noticeable. I do not think there was anything nefarious going on. I am sure this is as much of a Suprise to them as it is us.) 

We have not had an electrical guy out there yet, but I imagine a total re-wire/new box etc is really needed. A guy over the phone quoted me about 19-20k for a total rewire, but that wasn't including a box.  The other thing to realize is the walls are plaster which I hear is a pain, then you have to get that repaired and painted and I have no idea how much that would cost yet. (Anyone have any clue on that part too? Also I heard this can uncover asbestos....then what?)   


Anyway, we signed an ""as-is"" contract, so the seller is not \*obligated\* to help out at all, but I may ask if they would be willing to come down on price a bit etc to help out with repairs. If they do that, I think we would still do it no problem.  

But without? Ehhh...I dunno. 

Now, we were going to redo a bunch of stuff anyway: Paint, adding custom closets, polishing Terrazzo, removing popcorn ceiling in one room etc, so it's not like we thought there wasn't anything to do to the house. We also knew wiring can be a problem in old places, but we didn't know a thing about cloth wiring until yesterday. (Boy have we learned a lot on 12 hours!! lol.)   


Bottom line: It's Cute 1964 house we love with TONS of style that checks a lot of boxes for us, in a prime area where all the houses are either being turned over or torn down and new homes being put in....but we just got this bomb yesterday.  Obviously, I am going to have an electrician look it over before any real decision is made, but I wanted to get your Guys's opinions.     


Part of the reason the sellers turned down other offers is because they did NOT want the house torn down. They are in love with it and put a TON of work into it thinking they were going to be there for decades.  There is a reason it got 12 offers in two days! It's cool!  They were really putting down roots, then the husband got a job transfer.   


I guess the options are:    
1.  Pass on the house, they put it back on the market--which I know they don't want to do.  
2. Just pay for the rewire, readjust budget from somewhere else etc.  
3. Ask the sellers if they want to commit to helping pay for the cost despite the as-is nature of the deal.  


Anyway, blah blah blah...what are your thoughts? I assume if it would go back on the market, the seller would now have a pain in the butt to deal with because the listing would now have to note in the seller's disclosures what's wrong and that may turn off people. (I still think they would get offers though.) They may be back to only cash only tear down offers which isn't what they wanted, but now we see why people with ""real money"" tear down, I guess.    


I do know they are tired and want to be done with the house as he has already moved out of state, and she wants to join him with their kids. Showing the house was very hard for her logistically.  I think that may give us some leverage with them on the cost of repairs, but I dunno.

The specific requirement is that the installed flooring must reach an [IIC sound insulation rating](https://www.acousti-tech.com/en/Blog/abcs-of-acoustics/impact-noises-what-is-the-difference-between-iic-fiic-and-aiic-2090.html) of 80 dB.  This is actually a big deal to me because I absolutely *hate* carpet.  Here is the relevant text from the HOA rules:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In any Residence which is located above another Residence (“stacked”), the floor shall remain carpet or vinyl as it was originally completed. The installation in these Residences of flooring consisting of wood or any other hard surface floor coverings is prohibited without prior Board approval.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cork flooring may be installed with Board approval. The manufacturer specified floor IIC specification without an underlayment shall be a minimum of 55dB. The flooring and underlayment in combination shall achieve a IIC specification minimum of 80dB. The underlayment shall meet a minimum Delta IIC specification of 15dB. \* The homeowner must appear before the Board to present the product they want to install. The cork flooring should include an additional underlayment to reduce sound. The owner should be prepared to show the acoustic rating of the cork flooring and underlayment. The owner is still responsible for any disturbing noise from the cork flooring and may be required to take mitigating actions.

(I'm trying to get in contact with HOA board members.  This has been very challenging for very stupid reasons.)

# Questions:

* **Insane Requirements? :** The requirement of 80 dB seems crazy given that I can't find any kind of flooring, even carpet that actually meets that criteria.   Maybe I'm just not looking in the right places?  Any insight here?  Is there actually a combination of good underlayment and LVP/hardwood flooring that would meet the 80 dB criteria?  
* **Cork flooring ok? :**  It appears that cork flooring is basically allowed but I have absolutely no experience with cork flooring.  It seems like it wouldn't be durable at all, which is one of the primary benefits of laminate or hardwood flooring.  Is cork flooring a terrible idea?

501,toshni2021,How to Decorate Candles in Your Living Room,"Candles can be quite nice to use in the living room, but you might have trouble thinking of creative ways to decorate them so that they look as good as they smell. This article will show you how to decorate candles in your living room so that your candles are not only useful but beautiful.

**Candle Tree**

If you’re looking for something truly eye-catching, try a candle tree. It might not be practical for everyday use, but it will draw attention when you need an extra centrepiece for a special event. To create your own candle tree, pour melted wax into a frosted glass container until it is half full. Add small candles until they cover at least one-third of your glass container.

**Candle Wraps**

A great way to make candles more decorative is with candle wraps. Candle wraps come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, including flowers, snowflakes, and even pumpkins for Halloween. There are many types available for purchase on Amazon (search for candle wraps) but you can also find a few tutorials online that teach you how to make your own. These are a very affordable option and are so simple—all you need is wrapping paper or scrapbooking paper!

**Wire Candle Holders**

These chic candle holders made from copper wire will certainly add a modern touch to your living room decor. You can use any metal wire, however, such as steel or iron. All you need is a bit of glue and metal cutters. First, cut three pieces of wire that are approximately 1/2-inch longer than your candle’s height and width. For example, if your candle is 3 inches tall and 4 inches wide, cut four lengths of wire measuring 5 1/2 inches long each.

**Other Ideas**

If you don’t care for vases, why not try a candle? There are all sorts of creative ways to present candles around your home. Simply lay one on its side and plant flowers or greenery around it. Group several together and use as accent pieces, place them down your fireplace or in corners of your bedroom. You can even get really fancy and display them vertically, grouping several heights together in stair-step formations.",HomeImprovement,1645770053

515,Tiger_Any,Plumbing. Snake is unable to reach city main line,"First time posting to reddit and HomeImprovement.  Sorry if my terminology is off, first time homeowner as of a year ago.

Live in the upper midwest.  House from mid 70s.  Yesterday our basement sink started leaking from the stubout which was not connected to anything as I am in the slow process of replacing the sink.  We almost never use the basement utilities.  Probably a couple of gallons leaked out, was not frank sewage.  At the same time the sewage ejector started running for several hours which it almost never runs.

&amp;#x200B;

We had a plumber come out today, I was at work but inlaws were in town visiting, plumber told them not an issue with the sewage ejector or the one way valve connected to it.  They said it was a clog in the main sewer pipe.  Plumber took off the cleanout cap, which he said was not threaded and could not be placed back on so would need a temporary cap and then later replace the piping right around it.

&amp;#x200B;

Plumber tried to snake for a few hours but reached 130 feet and said did not reach the blockage and did not reach the city sewer line, explained snake would not be affective any further.  At this time he recommends placing a clean out pipe in middle of yard to finish the job (costing $5,000) which they can do tomorrow.  He then said the temporary cap did not fit so the cleanout is just open for the rest of the night so can not use any water, showers, etc

&amp;#x200B;

So 2 questions.

1.  Can snakes go further then around 130 feet and is it worth getting a second opinion?  Home depot rents one that goes 200 feet
2. Can I try to cap with something like this test plug so we have time to get a second opinion? [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Oatey-Gripper-3-in-Plastic-Mechanical-Test-Plug-33402/100168770](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Oatey-Gripper-3-in-Plastic-Mechanical-Test-Plug-33402/100168770)

He said that the next person to come out after I sign will be the guy to take some final measurements, I guess for insulation (I am having more added) and other materials. That he will be the one to inspect the rafters and the contract can be amended if he thinks rafter work is needed.

&amp;#x200B;

I am little worried though that the next guy to come out will be equally a little ""it looks fine"". I am certainly not looking for problems or to spend unneeded money. If these look good, fantastic. If something needs to be done though, now is probably the best time and I don't want to have problems later.

What do you think, these look good to go to slap a new roof on for the next 30 years?

The level in the basin was almost at the top so I quickly cut the pipe before the freeze and water flooded out and pump ran for awhile. The problem was where I made the cut water would drain back down into ground and get re collected I think and it just kept on pumping out water then collecting it over and over for about a day and a half. When stores opened up I bought a hose and ran it down the driveway where it normally goes. Problem is even after 2 days of water being redirected and freezing temps with no rain at all (there shouldnt be much water to be pumped out) it still runs every minute or so and dumps a little bit of water out. I'm scratching my head wondering where all this water is coming from. the amount seems less then usual but I've never seen it run this much ever in 2 years I've lived here.

522,Poopforce1s,Help with my laminate floor direction.,"https://imgur.com/a/cNrHi6B

Somewhat to scale drawing of the area. Directions used are in relation to the orientation of the drawing.

 Its an open landing where you can see down to the first floor. The two rooms on the ends are both corner rooms. The middle room is the smallest and only has one window.

I feel like it makes sense to run the floor top to bottom for the corner rooms, which would run parallel to an outside wall as well as run parallel to the longest wall.

The middle room, however, I'm not sure about. The longest wall is not the outside wall, so I'm slightly torn between top to bottom and left to right.

Then on top of this, that landing is a nightmare. Angles everywhere. I feel like in a vacuum, the flooring would look best going side to side, but I worry that the diagonal doorways to the two corner rooms would have some dissonance going on at the transitions.

An I overthinking this? Or underthinking it?

- How does blowing insulation over existing fiberglass batts impact insulation? The existing insulation is in decent shape, but I did notice a couple of the batts were moist. This would defeat the purpose as I’m looking for easier access to the electric work, but wanted to ask 

- For anyone who has gone through this process, how much does insulation removal increase cost prior to blowing in insulation? My attic is about 1100 sq ft for reference

568,diwhythough,Testing popcorn ceiling for asbestos,"Hi,

I’m new here. But yes, I have read the big “read me first” post on asbestos. And I still have a couple of questions I’d love some advice on. 

We recently bought a house built in 1979. It has popcorn ceiling in two rooms (front hall and living room). We’re in Canada, if that matters. 

I don’t love the texture and am currently waging war against the existing wall colour, so I figured I’d send a sample off to a lab. 

I scraped off the front hall in three different places, put it in a bag and mailed it to a lab. (I just sent one sample, because I figured it it came back positive, that would be the end of any DIY attempts). 

The results came back as being under reporting levels - which means it’s either less than 0.5% concentration or there was no asbestos found. 

Now my questions is, what further testing should I do before I start scraping it off?

I figure send in at least one sample of the living room to be safe. Should I send in two more samples from the front hall?

I have two small kids and am keen to err on the side of caution. But also I don’t want to send off and pay for needless samples. 

And yes, I realize the scraping process is messy and a huge pain. I am planning to start with the much smaller hall before even thinking about the living room.",HomeImprovement,1645744484

We eventually want to replace the kitchen and dining room floor-- should we do that first and build the cabinets on the new floor? Or should we build the cabinets on the subfloor?

*HVAC guy said it could be the hydro air unit filters, I replaced one, doing other soon now apparently. Especially after a reno dust can collect he says.. Another HVAC guy looked at the duct work and was like, everything looks super clean so doubtful...
*last night when it came on it was only on like 5 seconds though the previous few times this winter it was like 30 seconds of them all going off. Then stops.
*Co2/smoke alarm combos
*Natural gas furnace with hydro air units for HVAC
*ALWAYS when the heat happens to be blasting on
*furnace guy confirmed, heat isn't getting above a threshold which causes them to switch on either (another trouble shoot).

Also, I already know many will say it’s fine as is and what I am asking is only aesthetic. I am completely aware of that, but my question still stands

627,RySourdough,Question/Suggestions Needed for Countertop,"Hello,

Newish to Reddit, but hoping I could get help on a dilemma I've been facing for countertop. 

Fiancé and I are looking to upgrade the kitchen where we will be repainting/adding new hardware to the cabinets, painting the walls, adding new backsplash, etc. but would like to leave installing new countertop for the professionals. We both love the look of butcherblock, but are honest with ourselves that we will probably not do a good job of maintaining the wood, cleaning up water spills promptly, etc. and wanted to look for butcher block ""alternatives"". 

[https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/saeljan-countertop-oak-effect-laminate-80439214/](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/saeljan-countertop-oak-effect-laminate-80439214/)

This is what we are sort of looking for where it looks like a solid piece of butcherblock, but is actually a more forgiving laminate. I'd buy this in a heartbeat, but would prefer a darker color (the wood in our house is more of a darker wood/walnut, and thought matching wood as much as possible would look nice). I've seen the laminate sheets like the one below matching the color pretty well, but not sure how durable/nice the laminate sheets would look over the existing countertop.

I've done a bit of looking around and can't find anything similar to that Ikea laminate ""butcher block"" in a color that would match. Is there a sort of ""faux"" butcher block similar to that one where it may come in different colors?

643,KitchenReno4512,How much space do you prefer between your countertop and bottom of cabinets? Trying to decide between 36” or 30” tall cabinets.,"We have 90” tall ceilings (not 96”). We have two options for our cabinets. There’s 30” tall and 36” tall. Currently there’s a 54” gap between the top of the counter and the ceiling. 

The 30” tall would leave us a 4” gap from the ceiling and 20” gap between the counter top bottom of the cabinets. This is what we currently have and we like it because it makes our small kitchen feel more open. 

The 36” tall would sit a quarter of an inch from the top of the ceiling (gap needed because they are full overlay). And 17.75” from the bottom of the cabinet to the top of the counter. Ive read that 18” is “standard”. So maybe not such a big deal?

Our concern with that is the cabinets looking overwhelming and losing the “open” space on the counter. Our GC and cabinet maker both think we should do the 36” and that we’ll like it in the end because we get more space and they sit a little lower which makes the cabinet more accessible for shorter people.

647,bologne,Cistern Remediation,"  Hello reddit!

My house has an old cistern built into it. The cistern shares a single wall with the remainder of the basement - the walls of the cistern and entire basement are cinder block. On top of the cistern is a three-season room with an appx 4-inch-thick cement floor which is supported by I beams and corrugated steel (I assume the steel was just applied as a substrate to pour the cement on). The inside of the cistern is about 12ft x 12ft x 8 ft.

When we purchased the house the area around the cistern foundation was rather overgrown and had weed trees, brush, etc. Unfortunately, this masked an area of one of the side walls that has significant damage. It appears that the nearby tree growth along with poor drainage damaged the wall and allowed it to partially cave in.

We had a quote come for repairing the wall, and it is not going to be cost effective. It would be more economical to tear the room off and completely rebuild when considering the other updates that need to happen. Thus, I have decided to simply fill it in with recycled (crushed) concrete. My thought is to fill it higher than the foundation issue and leave about a 3 foot crawl space. This will keep the top of the fill slightly below ground level. I discussed with my friend who is a structural engineer and he does not believe that there will be any negative impact on the shared basement wall. I also intend to put a piece of perforated pipe vertically so that I can have a sump pump on the floor, just in case.

Sometimes when the weather changes drastically and there is high humidity, condensation occurs on the top of the concrete floor. After this project is done, I would like to put some sort of flooring (probably a nice thick vinyl plank) over the concrete in the three-season room. I am concerned that the condensation will still happen along the edges of the flooring and there will be a moisture/mold issue between the flooring and concrete. 

\- I feel like there is value in waterproofing the shared wall before the cistern is filled. Is this necessary and what is the best method?

\- Currently, there are ‘vents’ which are just holes where the gutters used to enter the cistern. Should these be plugged or covered to allow air but keep critters out?

\- What is the best way to get rid of moisture concerns on the top of the concrete floor? Is the moisture a real concern or will the other changes help address this?

My 39 year old concrete block foundation in my garage shows signs of what I believe to be intruding water damage (could someone confirm that suspicion based on pics?), the bottom 1-6 inches is crumbling and powdery (efflorescence?). 

My question is, how serious is this? How far does remediation need to go? Is the structure in danger of major issues, or is this a cosmetic issue? The area around the house is pretty much flat, no obvious grade issues but maybe flat is enough of an issue. There's also a sump pump but it never seems to run due to the pit never filling up much.

I should note that the previous owners didn't have any sort of roof drainage, and gutters w/ downspouts away from the house were installed a year ago when we moved in. I'm hoping the gutters are enough for remediation, but wondering if there are any ways to check if this issue is still occurring, some kind of moisture test?

As far as covering up the current damage, I'm planning on a structural concrete patch followed by primer, paint, and some pvc trim on top because I'm no concrete artist. I read that using waterproofing sealant on the inside is a no-no as I'd just be trapping more water in the concrete, so I'll avoid that.

Are their pipes somehow made or insulated differently?

Does everyone just know to drip their faucets?

Are there other methods of making sure your pipes don't freeze or burst?

661,stere0atypical,How to best conceal a basement access door in backyard," I'm in the process of planning out removing my backyard deck and replacing it with a paver patio, but there's one element that I'm stuck on.

We have a basement access door (bulkhead, bilco door, whatever you want to call it) right next to the slider connecting to our kitchen. When we remove the deck and put a step-down to the patio, this ugly door is going to be front-and-center.

I was trying to figure out a way to incorporate a way to conceal it with the step-down from the slider, but I'm at a loss of how best to do this. The current layout looks like this: [https://imgur.com/a/mJaXsnn](https://imgur.com/a/mJaXsnn)

662,MashTunOfFun,Three heaters on a circuit (240v 20a),"I have a 240v 20a circuit which controls two baseboard heaters. One heater is 1500w, and the other is only 400w (small bathroom heater.) These are both controlled by a MYSA thermostat. Knowing the 80% rule, this leaves me with 1,940w ""free"" on the circuit (80% of 4800 is 3840, minus 1900.) I have a Cadet in-wall forced air heater rated at 2,000w which I would like to install in my garage which I use as a workshop (other side of the wall from the 1500w baseboard heater.) This brings me 60w over the 80% rule, so it's more like 81%.

The Cadet heater would not be connected to the thermostat; I'd connect it on the run between the panel and the thermostat.  I would seldom run all heaters at the same time, and the Cadet forced air heater in the garage would only be run for 30-45 minutes at a time and then shut off-- not continuously.

Demoed everything down to studs. Jan of 2021 we were both back to work full time and so the project got put to the side, with little bits getting done here and there. Over the last two years, I wired and installed all the new light fixtures and vent fan as well as all the plumbing for the new shower system. Played hell getting our plumbing all figured out, but finally after numerous house calls to my plumber friend it’s all said and done. Had an electrician come out and check.. everything is done correctly and up to code. Sweet. Next step…

All that is left is a small drain relocation, lay down a shower pan, hang/finish drywall and cement board. Then paint and tile! I have plenty of experience hanging/finishing drywall and painting, but not moving drains, laying a shower pan, or tiling. So figured it would be best to hire a local contractor. He came by with his crew of three to check it out and see what all needed to be done and he agreed that it was something he was able to do, and then we agreed on a price. My thought was to get that drain moved and pan laid so that I knew exactly where the shower would start/end for the cement board, and then hang all the drywall and mud/tape it all before tile. 

They got to work yesterday moving the drain and laying the pan, and I was excited to get in there when I was off this weekend to hang the ceiling and walls mud/tape, and then have them come back to finish the tiling in the shower and floors… but these guys move quick. Like really quick. By the time I got home from work, they had moved the drain, laid the pan and TILED THE ENTIRE SHOWER. They installed their own cement board, which was cool, but they did the entire two walls in the corner where the shower is all the way up the wall to the unfinished ceiling joist. Complete with a really nice metal trim finish, all that’s left is to grout. It’s an absolutely beautiful job… however… I still need to hang/finish my ceiling and walls … is there any way I can do this still with the shower all but finished?

The layout of the house is basically a long uppercase L with the master bedroom being the very short end of the L and the other bedroom 3/4 of the way towards the corner of the L.

The location of the HVAC is in the basement and located towards the opposite end of the L and is a relatively new system (2015) and the previous owner did commercial HVAC so hopefully it's sized properly.

I purchased Govee thermometers to measure the temp in these rooms. When our thermostat (located in the center of the home) is set to 70, these rooms are typically 3-4 degrees different with doors closed.

Suspect #1: Windows.
I applied plastic film to see if sealing the windows in these rooms impacted temperature. The impact was negligible.

Suspect #2: leaky ducts
I sealed the ducts in the crawlspace with mastic tape, sealed all the connections at / near the furnace as well, then also sealed the registers. Lots of mastic tape later, minimal impact to the temperature difference but home efficiency overall improved.

Suspect 3: Poorly insulated crawl
The crawl in the original part of the house had no insulation. I have insulated the rim joists and sealed the sill plate gap. Putting rigid foam board on the walls is on the to do list. The addition crawl has foam board on the walls but they used fiberglass batting for the rim joists (currently working on replacing those with rigid foam). Floors are old wood floors and the temp of the crawl is generally 65-66 if thermostat is at 70.

Suspect 4: Poorly insulated walls
The significant number of exterior walls in both rooms makes me feel that this is a significant influence but not sure what a solution would be or how to confirm. I have a thermal camera but walls didn't jump out as especially cold.

The attic does have blown in cellulose and the ceiling is a consistent temp across the house.

Suspect 5: poor airflow
The master bed is at the extreme other end of the house. Not sure how to tell if a normal amount of airflow is coming through the vents.

The other bedroom only has one 2x10 vent (and a return). It's a small bedroom but I'm wondering if that is insufficient.

723,DeezMuhfuhNizzuts,Can you add an interior drain tile system into a sump to a basement that has an exterior French drain that drains to daylight.,"I am currently having some water issues in a 15 year old home that sits in a sometimes wet area. The current drainage system consists of an exterior French drain to daylight (actually a creek) with two interior sump pits at opposite ends of the basement that are connected to no other drainage.  

This home was purchased from the builder a few years ago, who stated not to even run the sump pumps, and they were unplugged when we moved in. He had some previous water issues and actually added the 2nd sump pit, and redid the exit to daylight portion of the drain during the sale of the home. The drain to daylight run is approximately 150 feet. Pitch is unknown. The drain pipe certainly clears a lot of water, and there is at least a trickle at all times. 

I have had 4 water occurrences in 4 years of ownership, 2 minor, 2 major in the past week. 3 of the 4 times the French drain exit was reached by the creek, so I assumed this was the root cause. The last time, the exit was not yet blocked but we had heavy rain.

The water ingress is from below slab starting at the basement wall seam and will gradually reach the entire perimeter including coming thru the central floor drain.  Even with both sump pits turned on and running almost non stop, water will still overwhelm this system.  I have powerful pumps that will pump the pit down to the bottom that are set on timers of about 45 seconds to prevent short cycling, so this to me doesn’t seem to be the issue. 

All my gutters drain into buried pvc pipes that lead far away from the home, the home has a slight slope away from it, but does have a sealed about 30 feet away on one side that sees a significant amount of water roll thru. ( this also happens to be the side the French drain leaves the perimeter towards its exit to daylight) and also is where initial flooding will begin in the basement. 

I have read that you cannot add an interior tile system if the basement already had a French drain on the exterior or the interior will simply be overwhelmed. Does anyone know if this is true?

My options I feel are to have an interior system installed (if this is an option) and build a surface water collection system into the swale to prevent water seepage below ground as much as possible, and even possible an outside pump linked to the French drain system that works to actively pump water out of the area if a high water level arises. (Dumb but I am searching for ideas) or anything else that might be an option I am unaware of.

The most confusing part is this is a 5000 sf home, the builder is a high quality builder with lots of great things about the home, but seemingly installed an inferior drain system. Hindsight is 20/20 and I believe he did it in an attempt to not rely on pumps and be free of worry, but certainly that was not achieved.

I have a window that *should* be operated by the single arm crank, but no matter what I do, it won’t open. The crank spins aimlessly (in both directions) &amp; nothing happens, it is as though the crank is not attached to anything. I included in the photos a downward angle attempting to show the slight gap between the bottom of the window and the wood moulding/sash(?), and in that gap you can see some sort of hardware (circled in red), so it looks like the hardware that should connect to the crank IS there. 

I also included a photo of the locking mechanism. I can’t push the locking mechanism all the way down, but I can sort of hear ~stuff (which I assume is the locking hardware) moving inside the window when I move the lever up and down. In the photo of the locking lever, if you look closely where the wood moulding/sash(?) and window meet, it almost looks like there is a piece of metal sticking out from the locking mechanism area, into the window. That metal thing does not move at all, regardless of the position of the locking lever.

Questions

1 Our house is 65 feet. Can we get away with 2 downspouts? 

Had two professionals come out to look. 

One strongly recommended 3 downspouts. 

I can’t see a way to add one in the middle without it looking awful (please see photo- front of house).

2 Currently there are no downspouts, just these chains (please see photo- chain). 

What’s the disadvantage of the chains compared to downspouts (other than being able to drop the water exactly where you’d like)? 

Not horribly averse to downspouts, but they do look uglier, and could pose a tripping hazard.

3 Looking that the front of the house the left corner is a high point. 

There seems to be some sort of engineered drainage, from ground surface, maybe an 8 inch diameter pipe with coarse gravel (please see photo- drainage). 

Would you dig this up to see what it is? 

Or use some other method to assess if whatever is there, is doing the job it is meant to? 

Notably, this end of the house is a former carport, so the crawl space does not extend to this corner. 

The nearest corner in the crawlspace, appears dry/no obvious mold/water damage.

Any other general gutters/drainage advice appreciated!

It's hard to get a house of similar size of what we desire right now in our area (atlanta).

We had this crazy idea of doing the second story add on after a house a few rows down did a similar thing and it looked great.

I think I saw some pics of glazes that sort of imitate wood texture but looks kind of dirty to me. @.@ What do you think (considering appearance, budget, and risks)?

746,ActualVegetables,Mortar for fieldstone foundations,"Northeast US, 100 year old building. 

We had the pleasure of discovering the mortar in a corner of our fieldstone foundation is deteriorating enough to let unwelcome critters in. We’ve received three quotes so far to repoint. What type of mortar is appropriate for this repair? My research on Reddit and other sites is mixed. Some say not to rely on Portland cement alone or else it will lead to early failure of the repointed areas. 

All three quotes we’ve gotten so far say they will use Portland cement. One guy said he would use antifreeze and PVA mixed with Portland cement. Another said just Portland cement and sand. All three looked at me like I was crazy for asking if lime was necessary since the dust in our basement shows there was likely lime present in the original mortar. One guy (antifreeze + PVA dude) said that was outdated and putting more lime on top of what is already there will cause more dust and deterioration over time.

We're in a modern build in the PNW - but with the heat wave last year and 2 little kids - we were hoping that ductless would help us ensure that we're not seeking out AC in a friends basement this summer.

3 bedrooms on a second floor. Master is west facing and takes the brunt of the heat. We're considering an outside shade to deploy during the afternoon sun.

The kids room and guest room are on the north and east sides of the house.

All share a common central hallway with high ceilings.

We are thinking that we can put the ductless in the hallway and maybe a second in the master bedroom. 

But should we abandon that and put separate units in each bedroom and just keep the doors closed?

Unsure of the best thing to do here, and now sure how much 'consultation' we'll get from an installer.

Is there a strategy?

A few sections of wall in the house goes all the way to the slab including this one.  My questions are: 

1) Do you think the drywall could be wicking moisture from the slab and in turn transferring moisture to the framing?  The house is a replumb, so it's not a plumbing leak in the slab unless it's possible to still be wet from a leak before the replumb (10 years ago, before we bought it).

795,Even-Celery-1299,Advice on next steps - Cabinets from The RTA store / Fabuwood with major issues,"Hi Home Improvement,

We are in the middle of our 3rd fixer upper, but first experience trying to remodel with supply shortages. 

We got a great deal on a house, knowing we would want to reconfigure the kitchen and replace all the cabinets, which were moldy around the sink from a leak. 

I contacted multiple custom cabinet makers in our new area and everyone was booked except one, who I talked to over the phone and he said it would be about $80k for what I had in mind, which was not in budget.

Our first remodel was a much smaller townhouse, but we had a great experience with Lowes, and from design to install was around a 1.5 month process, so we decide to do that, except now cabinets are at least 8 months out and they can't guarantee a timeframe.

We decide to move forward with having someone measure and doing the design. Will cost around $30k, plus installation, which is doable. But the ""at least 8 month"" turnaround time is less desirable.

In the meantime I am searching for other options, and I found [thertastore.com](https://thertastore.com). They offer cabinet lines that go to the ceiling (which was my must have). I order a bunch of samples and thought the quality of the doors was really good. They seem super durable, we put them through a LOT and they held up. Total cost is $24k and they will ship in 2-4 weeks! Order is placed December 16th.

While this is all going on, out kitchen has been gutted. We live in the upstairs with our 2 and 4 year olds and eat way too much takeout. Trenches are dug to move plumbing and electrical, walls are removed, it's a huge mess. I'm really thankful that we are not DIYing this one like the last 2, because just living through it has been stressful enough. 

Meanwhile, our island cabinets, which are a different cabinet maker than the wall cabinets, arrive. It's a total of 6 cabinets and a bunch of trim pieces. 1 of the doors has a small scratch/chip, one of the fronts of the boxes has tool marks, and the drawer front of one is cracked. 3/6 with issues, BUT, they seem like they're easy fixes. They get back to me quickly and say they'll send replacements. I'm not super thrilled about having to disassemble the cabinets I paid more for to BE assembled, just so I could re-assemble them with fixed pieces, but I'll live. They were well packaged and I just want my kitchen finished!

Another month goes by, so now it's been  a little over 8 weeks since I placed my order. I get an email about a few of the cabinets being on backorder. Fine. The other wall cabinets arrive that weren't on backorder.  These ones are the ""Fabuwood"" brand. While the packaging wasn't damaged in shipment, they were all packaged terribly. Literally just a cardboard box, and some had that thin lining of plastic/foam paper inside them. Every single one is damaged in some way. The cabinet boxes are also assembled poorly and are crooked. 

I made a google drive, documented everything, with folders for each cabinet containing all the photographs. It took my husband and I like 5 hours over the course of 3 days to open them all and take the photographs. They agree my order has extensive damage. I tell them I want someone to pick these up and refund my money so I can go elsewhere.

So now I've been going back and forth with them for over a week, and their solution is to send me replacement PARTS for my 28 damaged cabinets (this doesn't include the island cabinets). Oh and give me a 50% refund of the extra warranty I purchased (so $300 discount). I don't find this at all an acceptable solution. I picked these cabinets because they were fast and I paid extra for pre-assembled cabinets because I didn't want to have to assemble cabinets myself, or even have our contractor do it. 

I feel very ripped off here. If I knew it was going to take months I would never have used them. I know it's an online RTA store, but I looked at reviews, I even know someone who used them a few years ago and had a good experience. The samples seemed like they were nice. But they are not. These are TERRIBLE quality cabinets. The construction of the island cabinets vs. these wall cabinets is night and day. 

They said the cabinet manufacturer does not offer any refunds. Do I have any other options in this? Dispute with my credit card? Report them somewhere? I'm so lost. I can't take a $24k hit on these but also it seems like MORE of a waste of money to install them, countertops, backsplash, etc. just to have to replace in a few years when they fall apart. That is if I ever manage to get ones that aren't damaged in the first place...

On the surface, it really doesn't seem all that complicated. I need to understand what pipes I have going where, with what sizes, and where the kitchen/bathroom feed into the existing system. Then purchase the PVC/ABS parts to perform a one-for-one replacement of the entire system. Am I oversimplfying?

Yes, it'll be gross. Yes, it'll be a cramped and obnoxious. Yes, the cast iron will be heavy and cumbersome. And those are all the reasons why a plumber will charge so much for labor, I presume.

House- midcentury brick small ranch

Two years ago we decided that we needed to update our 70 year old windows, but we also wanted to try to replicate the look with modern technology. 

Window World had the best quote- not the cheapest but they could do what we wanted- which was a bunch of huge casements and a handful of massive picture windows. So we signed the paper, summer of 2020. 
 
Many of the windows were installed in the summer of 2021, and the delay seemed reasonable with the pandemic. 

About 1/3 needed to be remade because they were the wrong size or in a few cases the wrong color (we’re doing black). That’s fine. Mistakes happen. 

But, the office manager never writes anything down, just “keeps it all up here,” so many of the remakes were wrong too. 

Today they just came by for with a third round of remakes, and there is still one basic issue (wrong glass, in a window, was supposed to be clear, is pebbled for bathroom, which again I get but is explicitly not what we ordered). It is the third window they’ve tried there, and they now need to make a fourth. 

We are waiting for remakes on 3 other windows as well. 

We put half down- about 15k, and will pay the other half in the event that the project is ever completed. 

Now, however, I’m noticing other issues emerging- weird bowing in glass, color falling off outside, some kind of insulating fluff coming out around the frame, etc. 

If I was in charge of window world there would be an AR app that shows what the windows are going to look like and requires a customer signature before they’re made. 

Anyway, it’s been two years, original estimate was a nonbinding 6 months, these are the issues- how bad or unusual is this and what’s appropriate for me as a homeowner, if anything, to ask for here? I sort of feel like we should get some kind of partial refund.

809,PkunkFunk,Failure of Light Switch or of the Light Fixture?,"Hi all. Very inexperienced so please excuse any incorrect terminology, but I'll do my best to be clear. Posting from Toronto, Canada.

Recently when my husband was turning on lights in the kitchen, there was a ""pop"" sound and the main kitchen lights no longer worked (one pendant type light over the island, and 3 potlights over the counters). The breaker did **not** flip, however, and a second light in the kitchen on the same breaker continued to work fine. We know little about electrical work, but a friend suggested testing to see whether the problem was the fixture or the switch by essentially connecting the circuit without the switch and seeing if it lit up. After overcoming our nerves, we did just that.

The light came on, so we thought we had our answer, and we went out and bought a replacement switch (actually two, as you can see in the photo) and replaced them. After we'd reconnected it up, we flipped the breaker back on and... it worked! I know this is literally the simplest electrical task in the world, but we felt like Tim Allen on Home Improvement.

It went about as well as things did for him on the show, however. The next day, my husband changed some of the bulbs in the pendant light (new 60w LEDs), but when he went to turn the lights back on... another pop, and the lights are dead again.

Clearly we are missing something. Either a second switch has coincidentally failed in the exact same way (seriously unlikely), there is something wrong with the wiring that we don't understand, or the fixture is somehow the cause. I'm just not sure how to proceed, and if this is a situation where we need to ask the landlord to call in an electrician, or if it might still be an easy fix (ie replace the fixture... even we know how to do that).

Can anyone offer any guidance? I'm not expecting miracles, but even if you have ideas about things we should try or what the cause could be, it would be helpful in deciding what we do next. Thank you very much in advance.

[https://imgur.com/a/NbmRmXa](https://imgur.com/a/NbmRmXa)

If relevant, behind the switches is the black wire we assume goes to the breaker box, which supplies power to both switches with a twist-on wire connector. A red wire for each switch seems to go to the separate circuits in the kitchen (one with the potlights &amp; pendant, and another one not shown that's over the kitchen table. That one still works fine). I apologize for my very layperson description of the wiring.",HomeImprovement,1645641986

We got some decent bonuses from our jobs that will hit next month and we want to put that into replacing our aging HVAC system.  The original system is from the year 2000 so I know we can be more efficient.  I'd like to replace it before it dies so I have options rather than being stuck with whatever is available because we all know these things die on the hottest/coldest days.  

Context: We live in Denver.  We have solar - unsure of capacity but in the summer we make enough to offset all our electric usage, including AC use.  The current system is forced air, gas heat.  We use an Ecobee thermostat.  Our energy company (who does our gas and electricity) is switching us to TOU, it would cost more to opt-out.  3500 sq ft house with a basement.  We have rooms that are cold and rooms that are hot so smart vents or something similar would be a welcome addition.  

I've been attempting to get energy audits from certified contractors via my energy company but so far none have reached out after I've initiated contact.  But I know we could stand to make a few changes to be more efficient (windows, air sealing, insulation) along with the new HVAC.  A whole-home battery system is also on our radar for this year.  

I'd love a heat pump system with dynamic gas/forced air backup (different than emergency heat) or that could be programmed.  Something that's smart enough to track sun and solar would be nice if that exists - this would allow it to go ahead and run during high TOU if needed if we're getting enough sun to offset.  We had a heat pump system in OK but always needed to run the emergency heat.

So what's the latest and greatest out there?  What should I be looking for?  What brands are good (Trane, Carrier?) and what should I avoid (Lennox, Goodman)?  Are heat pumps even viable here?

829,pawn_guy,PSA regarding home insulation and windows,"I've seen a lot of posts regarding gas bills on here lately asking about the reason for high gas bills or asking about the effectiveness of insulation and/or breezy doors and windows. Having just received my latest bill I thought I'd weigh in. 

I live in the midwest in a 2600sqft house (including the finished basement) and keep my temp set at 68 degrees 24hrs a day. Temps got down into the single digits multiple times and the average over the last month was around 35 degrees. My gas bill was only $120. That's at a price of $0.8583 per therm, which is much higher than last year here. 

My house was built in 1976, but remodeled 10 years ago with new insulation in all exterior walls including the basement, spray insulation in the attic, and new heavy plastic frame windows that seal extremely well. My thermostat is just a basic cheap digital one. The furnace is about 12 years old. My exterior doors were also replaced, and those are the only places I can feel a slight cold draft on very cold days. 

Just thought I would give some perspective for people contemplating spending money on new insulation and/or windows to save on utilities. Based on the sqft vs gas bills some have posted on here, I'd say it can often pay for itself pretty quick once you also figure in summer cooling savings if you live somewhere that fluctuates between 5 and 100 degrees every year like me.",HomeImprovement,1645636068

838,OmniClack,Concerns about air sealing attic and questions about loose fill vs spray foam insulation,"After a very expensive New England winter in my new home I've started the process of getting my attic properly insulated (right now it's basically not). I've only got a quote from one place so far but they gave me a couple options and have left me a bit confused. For context this is a single story 1000sq ft ranch.

First option is to air seal the ceiling and then blow in 18"" of blown insulation to get to R-49 (they didn't specify if this is cellulose or fiberglass). This was quoted at $4800.

Second option is to air seal/insulate the roof with open cell spray foam. This is where I get confused because the quote specifies the roof will get 9"" of foam to reach R-38 and the walls will get 5"" to reach R-23. This was quoted at $7000. Now I was never particularly good with math, but it seems to me the spray foam costs more money and yields less heat resistance, so what is the benefit? Does making the entire attic airtight make up the difference?

I also have some concerns about the idea of air sealing the roof. With no soffit vents and no ridge vent, how does the roof stay cool in the summer? I just got a brand new roof put on that cost me $7800. I'm not really in a hurry to cook my shingles. I'm also concerned with ice dams in the winter. My understanding is the air circulation between the soffits and the ridge vent maintain an even temperature on the underside of the roof in the winter preventing uneven snow melt. I guess if the whole roof is just evenly insulated it would accomplish the same thing, but I'm not sure. Is this a concern?

For context to the  problem I'm facing, I live in Southern Ontario, Canada...90% of the time  I love where I live. This is the other 10%.

In August 2021, I set  out to renovate and potentially insulate a reach-in closet in one of  the bedrooms--demo'ed the drywall + studs, and added in new studs,  insulation in the stud bays with acoustic sealant and tuck taped to the  studs (https://imgur.com/gallery/TCeKXDg), and added  moisture-resistant/green drywall.

Here's where I think I went  wrong: I left the closet walls mudded and I didn't finish/seal the  closet drywall. This is what I was supposed to prime the walls with  (https://www.homedepot.ca/product/zinsser-perma-white-mould-mildew-interior-paint-in-tintable-satin-3-78l/1000141406)

Flash-forward  to about 15 days ago when Ontario had a couple of rough snow-storms  where we got dumped with a lot of snow. During one of these snowstorms,  snow started piling up on the roof and, when it subsequently warmed up,  started melting.

Less than a day after the ice started melting, I  opened the unfinished closet to find moisture seeping through the mudded  drywall in the top right corner. This corner of the closet is directly  below the front-left corner of the house, which had a bit of an ice-dam  (I think).

866,MashTunOfFun,Cable Railing for Stairs (or another option?),"I just finished a basement renovation. The last thing I need to do is add a railing to the stairs going down to the finished basement. Having removed the old banister and balusters I really like the open feel and wanted to maintain that as much as possible so I was thinking about installing a cable railing. It's 9 steps total, and I was looking for a run on each side. I have no experience with the pricing for these, and was shocked when the quotes I got from two different companies were for close to $4k for the supplies only-- I planned to install it myself. I find it hard to justify that expense when it would be more than half what I already spent on the entire renovation. So I have a few questions:

1. Are these quotes in line with what I should expect? Is there a cheaper way to do this type of thing?
2. If I were to discard the cable railing idea completely, are there any other ideas / suggestions for railing designs that would maintain a more open feel?

867,md9918,When should I be concerned about the removal of this load-bearing post?,"[https://imgur.com/a/ClwFMip](https://imgur.com/a/ClwFMip)

Bought my house a year ago. Previous owners had to leave in a hurry and either did a DIY or Home Depot parking lot vagrant flip of the kitchen. I ripped out original wood paneling that had surrounded the stupid ""island"" and discovered a load-bearing post had been cut to accommodate the stupid island, and that it originally ran to the soffit as shown in red. There was some hairline cracking in the plaster (rock lath walls) as shown in lime green. I tore open the soffit to see what was in there, and it's 4 2x10s which support the roof along the 15 ft. span of the bump-out. The post was at the midpoint of the 15 ft span.

We located plans for a renovation drawn up by an architect from two owners ago, which included the removal of the wall containing the post (though he prob didn't know it was load bearing) so I emailed him about it. He responded that it ""wouldn't hurt"" to re-install the load bearing post, but it would probably be ok. 

Because replacing the post would disrupt the flow of our entire main floor, and require me to take an angle grinder to our granite countertop to notch it out for the post, I decided to button everything back up and keep an eye on it. 

Well, it's been a year now, and the hairline cracking is reappearing (lines are showing under the paint, but it hasn't separated the paint yet). My question is: is this to be expected due to the brittle nature of plaster and the fact that the roof support beams are  settling, or should I take this as a sign that it's only going to get worse before catastrophic failure?

Roof is made from trusses. It's about 13 feet from the centerline of the house to the 2x10s.",HomeImprovement,1645626655

876,glassbrickz,Basement flooding from backwater valve pit groundwater,"Hi all. We recently purchased a \~20 year old house with no disclosed history of flooding. 

Over the winter season, we've seen significant rainfall three times. Each storm, we've seen a substantial flood in our basement.

After the first flood, we engaged insurance, who brought in restoration services. The folks from that company dug up flooring after the second flood and discovered a very wet backwater valve pit. Pictured:

!\[Backwater valve basin showing \~1/4"" of water.\]([https://i.imgur.com/QbOiLCR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QbOiLCR.jpg))

After the mold abatement and mitigation had been completed, we decided to leave the basement in disarray until another storm came to prove that the backwater valve pit was the source of our flooding problem. 

Indeed, this past weekend we had \~100mm of rain, and the pit flooded. Luckily we minimized the amount of water taken in by opening up the backwater valve lid and the sewer system was able to take in the water. It drained all day at a high rate:

!\[A video of water underneath the basement slab draining into the city sewer via the backwater valve access\]([https://i.imgur.com/6iZ7OnO.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/6iZ7OnO.mp4))

A slight tangent: before we opened the lid, we saw seepage around the seams of our foundation and a few other points in the basement (around the grout of a toilet, around some now-sealed floor drains). When we opened the lid and let the water underneath our basement floor slab drain into the city sewer, the seepage stopped.

We will engage contractors on this project, but I thought I'd ask here, too:

1. What could be causing this pit to flood now, and not before?

2. What would you do to prevent it from flooding in the future?

3. If we seal this leak, we won't have a way of draining the water under the basement floor slab... do you think the seepage we started to see will become a problem?

On (2): the house's eavestroughs and downspouts all seem to drain directly into underground drainage systems, so the first thing we plan to do is add elbows to these and direct the water away from the house. 

We are also considering adding a sump pump—we do not currently have one.

First picture is the idea he proposed.

Second picture is apparently how my floor joists are sitting (can't see them 100% fully yet but this is what he felt and could see).

Let me explain. I live in an old house with large 6x6 floor joists for the second floor/roof. They are currently notched out and some are sitting on the old LVL and some are not. The house has sagged and shifted and apparently some are like 1/4-1/2 inch off the LVL beam and are basically unsupported.

He seems to not want to do sistering, basically considers it ""hack job"" and seems like he is completely against sistering the beams, although that seems like the best option to me if done correctly. There must be a way to sister 2nd floor/roof load floor joists securely and safely/to code but he doesnt want to do sistering.

So he suggested this method which is basically adding a strong steel angle piece that sticks out and the 6x6 floor joists that are short would sit on this steel.

The reason he suggested this is because his original idea was to add a fourth LVL beam to hold the short floor joists, but then I would have to ""fur"" out the wall to match that width with drywall, which would cause fitting issues for my cupboards and counters so thats why I was against that solution.

Do you think this is a safe, strong, and to code solution?

Let me know what you guys think about this option, or sistering the 6x6 floor joists properly to hold the load of a second floor and roof. Is it possible to sister these beams and extend them? Are there any other options we arent thinking of?

883,YoureInGoodHands,Counterpoint: Don't book a contractor to do work on your house six months from now. Call around until you can find someone who will come bid it in a week and start within a month.,"Plumbers, Electricians, Sheetrockers, Masons, Gutter hangers, Turf layers, Painters, Framers, Concrete guys, Deck builders... are largely commodity players.  Even the more ""artsy"" trades, tilesetting for example... you're either good at it, or you're not.

Do not put your project off for six months while you wait for the Picasso of sheetrock to free himself up for your job. 

When you call and they say they are booked out six months, thank them for their time and move on.  Keep calling until you get a few people to answer and give them an idea of your job.  If your job is under $5k (or you hope it'll be under $5k), you will probably not get an in-person bid.  After you speak to them by phone, take photos, take measurements, text them the photos and the measurements, and ask for an idea of cost.  I live in one of the most labor-impacted areas of the country and yes, it's hard to get three bids.  Be nice, be businesslike, and be patient.  You will get three bids.  Ask when they think they could start and how long the work will take.  **Ask who will be doing the actual work.** If it's not them, ask who it is and how often the person you are speaking to comes by.  The answer should be daily, at least.

Because you are not choosing the Picasso of sheetrock, you need to do a little legwork on legitimacy.  Is your contractor licensed?  They are supposed to have their license number on their marketing materials.  Check that license number with the issuing board.  Are they bonded/insured?  They should be willing to provide you with an insurance cert (with a phone number you can call to verify it), and if you ask, they should be willing to add you as add'l insured.

They should be willing to send/show you photos of finished work.  You can also ask for contact information of recent (within the last few weeks) customers (this would be for an over $5k job, generally).  The contractor should ask *you* questions over the phone/text.  ""Did you want the corners squared or rounded?  How tall is the ceiling?  What material came out?  What brings about this remodel?"".  The more questions they ask, the better contractor they are, and the better your bid will be.

For most projects (especially smaller projects), you should be able to find someone to come out within the month to take care of your home construction needs.

The drywall and insulation was in good shape, but the bottom plate of the wall is wet. I’m hoping this suggests there’s no other foundation water leak going on, but I’m not certain yet. 

The interior walls were built on top of the vinyl floor which is making it difficult to properly dry everything out. 

I am leaning towards removing drywall and insulation from the 4’ mark down, cutting out the bottom plate (it’s untreated wood sitting on old vinyl floor), and then running a dehumidifier for a while to dry things out and give me a chance to monitor for any more water issues. 

I would appreciate any feedback on this plan, as well as any tips for rebuilding. Not totally sure the best way to go about replacing the bottom plate, and reattaching the vapour barrier (can I tuck tape it along the top seem, and then caulk it to the bottom plate?).

Yeaterday, I noticed my bedroom lights flickering as my washing machine was running. Thanks to you guys, I realized this was not good, and was the result of either a loose neutral wire at my panel or a loose neutral or hot wire somewhere else on my bedroom circuit. After digging around, I found that one of the wires on my switch was loose, and popped right out of the screw terminal when I took it out of the box. 5 minutes later, no more flickering, a safer switch, and $75 bucks saved by not having to call an electrician.

So far I’ve used 2” foam board for the rim joists, but stuck on what to do with the sill plate. The gap next to the sill plate is only 1 1/2”, so I guess I’d need thinner board for that area.

It is on the top of a mountain and is set on a slope. So the basement is considered a walkout and only the back side is underground and half of each side. Overall it’s about 700 sq ft. I was planning on finishing only 450 sq ft. My plan is to leave about a 4 foot gap between the finished wall and foundation wall. That way I can get back there and store stuff (keep in mind on the back corners that are technically underground there is about a 10x10 foot space Im leaving unfinished bc the furnace and other stuff is back there.

I’ve had water problems in the past but I put in two sump pumps and not had any other problems yet. I have a humidifier down there rn that I keep going so that it stays around 50-55% humidity. I plan on leaving that dehumidifier behind the finished wall so it keep the humidity down back there. For the subfloor I put down dimple wrap underlayment then put advantech subfloor. Im building the wall off the subfloor. Im also using purple drywall.

My question is what else should I consider adding? Any suggestions on equipment? I’ve considered put a dehumidifier in the finished area as well, I’ve also looked into using ductless hvac so it would be on a separate system then upstairs. Another thing I’ve considered is installing some sort of ventilation system and even an air purifier. Is there like some sort of all in one system I could look into?",HomeImprovement,1645594249

Me: When the recent renovations were done in the kitchen area, all the proper precautions were done to make sure asbestos wasn’t getting released into the air right?

Landlord: There’s no asbestos in the building anywhere

Me: There were tests done?

Landlord: No tests were needed there was never asbestos in the building. This building was not built with any asbestos, it was built with bricks, stones, and wood.

So my landlord is completely clueless about this and now I’m terrified. What if he had the renovations done improperly, releasing a ton of asbestos which I’ve been breathing in? Do professional renovation companies always take asbestos precautions? What if they asked the landlord about asbestos and then assumed he knew what he was talking about?

This is an ouside wall in a corner that is particularly drafty since I opened up the wall. Just portion of the footer as well as the concrete beneath affected. The concrete beneath this footer is a separate chunk from the slab for the rest of this room and there's no basement or crawlspace beneath this room - for reference.

There was no water damage on the drywall here to begin with. I've had the wall opened for weeks and never noticed any moisture here until today after it rained all day. Since the footer and studs there feel solid and dont seem to be damaged I'm wondering if this is of major concern. This particular addition of the house has been here for probably 20+ years as far as I know and like I said, until I opened the wall up there was no sign of a water problem.

Very unsure about this, as I dont want to finish renoing this whole room just to have to break open the wall again later down the road due to a problem I could have prevented.

[Note to mods: re-posting this with request for ballpark pricing at the end removed.]

Apologies in advance for any formatting issues—I’m posting on mobile. 

**Background:** Spouse and I bought our 100+ YO home back in Sept. Sellers noted on the disclosure that water “on par for older homes in the neighborhood” gets into the basement. We noted one corner in particular that had very clearly experienced moisture issues. We saw a fair amount of moisture from an especially heavy rainfall after a wet week or so, and were hoping that would be worst case. But we’ve really been waiting for the snow melt to see how it truly goes. The time has come! It’s a pretty decent amount of water. (“On par” was uh, a bit of a downplay from the sellers, but you live and you learn.)

**Issue**: It appears the slope of our asphalt driveway, along with some areas that either have sunken or just weren’t properly graded to begin with, are basically funneling water straight into that corner of our house where we’ve seen moisture in the basement. We noticed the sunken parts, but we hadn’t realized the extent of the funneling until we were able to see the contrast of the dry parts of the driveway with the wet parts where snow melt moisture was collecting. I’ll try to attach some images that show both the “funnel” and the sunken bit that kinda butts up to the house. 

**Questions** After doing some research, it seems like mud jacking for asphalt isn’t really a thing. Is this accurate? And I suspect trying to use any sort of patching material to try and even things out would be 1) more trouble than it’s worth 2) a bandaid that will eventually fail at best. So. Is my assumption that we might have to just bite the bullet and get our driveway ripped out, graded properly and redone a safe one?

Our house is old, and we are in the process of redoing the floors and adding hydronic floors, we installed a tankless water heater in preparation for this however in this process I’ve discovered that going from our gas tankless to electric tankless is insanely impractical for our 4 bedroom/4 bathroom, 2500 square foot home.
Which is where the second problem comes in. Hvac. Currently we have a gas furnace, and I’m now looking at switching to a heat pump, at least until we can get around to doing the floors. The only concern I have is using the heat pump during the winter, We typically get down to single digits for about 1 month out of the year and I’m just wondering if that will be an ok solution, at least temporarily.

We purchased a 1940's home in NorCal and know of an incident with the previous owners where a water heater leak led to an environmental (mold/fungi) cleanup in and around the basement walls facing the heater from above.

We notice a musty odor all the time in the basement and if we close the windows and step out for a few hours, even the house starts smelling the same. 

Since moving in, we installed a dehumidifier, fixed the leak from the backyard by installing pavers and some drainage system for gutters to move the water away from the basement. Also, closed window vents with an awning. My guess is that the cement/cinder block (??)  walls let the moisture or the earthy smells seep in from other side.
 
Is there something we can do get rid of this smell? Some product to seal the walls on the inside or something else is causing this issue?

965,Jsmith55789,Furnace Replacement,"Hey everyone. We just bought a house back in June 2021 and part of the terms of buying was that it comes with a home warranty, which happens to be through HSA. Our furnace recently stopped working and we were told by a couple different HVAC people that we need to have it replaced, so we decided to try and take advantage of the warranty. The system in our house right now is a Carrier Infinity 58MVC080-14. I’m told it’s a good brand/model and my research says carrier is still a very good option. The insurance company sent someone out and then told us they will cover a “comparable replacement” for the furnace and we would have to pay out of pocket for materials/install fees. This would be about $2400 which I think is crazy because there shouldn’t be a need for that much work or materials, but I’m also not an HVAC professional. We are still trying to get them to tell us which carrier model they would replace ours with, but no luck yet so I’m worried it will be the absolute lowest model that still has the same BTU (80K) and efficiency (I believe 90%). So we found out that the option is to either take that offer, or have the insurance company do a cash payout of $1100 to us and we can pick our own company to do it at whatever cost it would be. We’ve talked to several places and it seems we can get the most direct carrier infinity replacement for about $4800 with install, or get a lower model for about $3800. We also talked to someone who doesn’t do carrier but said they can do a comparable temp star for about $2800-3000 total. I don’t know anything about temp star, but I’m wondering if we should take the $1100 and get the comparable temp star installed for $3000, effectively netting us $1900 out of pocket, or go with probably the most basic comparable carrier model for $2400 out of pocket?

 We are about to get solar on our house which should save us 200-250 dollars per month on electricity.   


We are constantly chasing down leaks in our roof. Spent about 5-6k since moving in 4 years ago, its a neighborhood wide issue, and now have leaks again.  We currently have an estimated equity of about 300k in the house because of the ridiculous market in our area.    


What is the smartest thing to do if we wanted to reroof so we don't have to worry about it once the solar is on? I am terrified of putting panels on it and the leaks getting even worse!!!! And now its coming up fast as the city approved our solar plan.   


We currently are quoted 5,000 in repairs (BEFORE the new leak) which never seem to really fix anything permanently and I can't see it getting any easier once there's a crap ton of panels up there. House is 1900sqft and has asphalt tiles. (How do these slip when nothing touches them and no one walks on them????????)  At what point is it considered as a home owner time to cut losses and just reroof the damn thing for peace of mind? 

What kind of $$ am I looking at? What is the most practical roofing solution for this problem? 

 Options for $$ below. Any and all advice and info appreciated. While I could frame you a house, I could not roof it  and have not yet had a solar system yet so knowledge is helpful to me! 

a) finance the roof through the roof company (don't have info on %s, we also have partial roof insurance/discount through American Home Shield partnered with RoofRX, so potentially a discount on the roof from them?  


b) refinance mort. again (potential points not sure what penalties or costs would be there, we actually got a bit of money BACK on the last refi in 2021, but I know that' not always how it goes and take out just enough for the roof? We like to leave our equity alone (I know there's a million arguments about that) . Also not sure if rates are as good as they were.   


c) home improvement loan from local credit union at probably a fairly good percentage as we have very healthy credit. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are in SoCal and basically any time we get anything like a driving rain, where the overlaps in the roof happen (have been repaired before) we get strange leaks . We also are single story and have a BIZARRE attic that makes it very very very hard to get to things because of the 12 foot ceilings.

The purpose of this thread is to provide a place for the /r/HomeImprovement hivemind to get a rough **estimate on project costs or to receive some feedback on existing project quotes**. Top-level posting in the sub on this topic has resulted in many low-effort posts, like ""How much will this cost me?"" which then do not provide any more detail.  For example, ""$50k to replace 20 windows!? Are they crazy?"" without mentioning the brand, dimensions, or quality. From here on out we will be removing these low-effort posts.

Read about this, and more, in our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/wiki/subrules).

&amp;nbsp;


Rule #1 for this topic is **GET  3 QUOTES**. One quote tells you almost nothing. Yes, contractors are in high demand so that may make it difficult which is why it is even more important to ask for, and obtain, details within the estimate.

As you probably know, quotes vary wildly depending on **where you live** as you can read about in [this handy post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/c5qfjk/how_much_will_cost_and_dealing_with_contractors/) which also has a great comments section.  Include your location such as ""SF Bay area"", Rural Wyoming, or Northern Manitoba.

If you are seeking reflection on a cost estimate or quote **include as many details** as possible. If you include a copy of the quote, please remove any identifying personal information - including the contractor name or company providing the quote.

Each segment should hold about 25-30kg at most (more likely closer to 15kg). The pipes are about 1,1kg per meter, the pine board is about 1,5kg per 90cm - so the construction alone for each segment should weigh around 4-5kg.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two basic questions:

Is mounting to the ceiling and wall the reasonable way to go? I see that the pipe flanges usually have 4 holes for the screws, so that makes 16 screws per segment. Is it safe with the shelf load I'm expecting?

If so, then which screws/anchors should I use? I live in a residential block from the 50s/60s, so the walls are bricks and the ceiling should be concrete.

It takes a pretty heavy rainfall to make it happen, and when it does the most it leaves is a little puddle in the corner.   Everyone out here is like ""Yeah? It happens.""   It almost seems like I'm lucky only getting a small leak every now and then the way they talk.   

That said, it makes me uneasy.   What can I do to seal this corner a little better?   Or would that just push the leak elsewhere?   Keep in mind, I'm on a bit of a budget here and can't really throw a few thousand at this thing at this moment.   The other corner of the basement does have a sump pump that can stay busy during incredibly heavy rainfall.  

I am including a picture of what is outside this corner.  There is no downspout on that corner (it is further down but not by far) but I've monitored it closely during rainfall and it is incredibly dry right there.   And I've checked that little well (where my gas meter is) and it stays incredibly dry as well so it isn't like the water is coming in from there.    Any outdoor mediation i can do?

The height to the bottom of the first floor (under the door) is 6"". Adding 1.5"" sleeper and 1"" deck would make it too high.

The upstairs floor is very creaky to the point where the cat walking on it makes it creak , no exaggeration. 

When we pulled up the carpet we found chipboard underneath in bad condition, been butchered with a circular saw in places to get access to pipes and just splitting in other places. 

My first thought was that plywood replacement would be economical and very strong. 

It seems that the most common materials (UK) are chipboard/OSB/ and pine ptg plans planks. 

Does the flooring definitely need to be tongue and grooved? In the old days planks with large spacing was used, although they probably did creak and were at least an inch thick. 

 I've seen it is possible to get plywood t&amp;g flooring but it's not common in diy centres, I might find it at a local merch. I've seen people online using a sledgehammer against a plank butted up to the sheet to seat it in the groove, is it really this difficult to put the two together and what do you do when you get to the wall? 

I've seen the other thing is you can use noggins, not sure if that's strictly necessary and might be difficult where pipes run. 

I guess it depends on joist spacing etc. 

The bathroom doesn't need doing this has a solid tiles floor which doesn't creak at all. I'm guessing the floor was reinforced before they were laid. 

Is there a guide anywhere which details any rules of thumb e.g. panel size etc. I could replicate what is already there but not sure how good it is.

1035,juleshark,Painted Stone Fireplace-- is German Smear still possible or are there better alternatives to achieve the same effect?,"Hi all--

I'm looking to update the façade of my fireplace ([pic](https://imgur.com/a/JceJUgj)), which is currently painted stone ([close up picture of the stone](https://imgur.com/FEmK1xj)). The actual stones are covered in a light brown paint while the mortar lines have been painted white. Also, before I get called out, the blasphemous act of painting the original stone was done at some point prior to my purchase of the home.


My desired end state for the fireplace would be something similar to [this](https://imgur.com/KtDUFfR), which I believe was achieved by applying mortar over stone via the German Smear technique and then painting it white. While researching the technique, I've found that most sources explicitly advise against applying mortar over painted brick/stone as the compound will only be bonding to the paint rather than the brick/stone itself. I've tested out removing the existing paint via a stripping gel or sandblasting and have determined that neither is really a viable route to take.


So my question for you is...would it really be so problematic to apply the mortar over painted stone? My goal isn't to completely cover the fireplace, but rather to roughly shallow out the mortar lines and soften the overall appearance of the stone so that it is less structured/linear in appearance. Do you think there's a better approach that could achieve the same effect (e.g. plaster with a bonding agent)?",HomeImprovement,1645560020

I'm trying to find flooring, and I stumbled upon Costco's Mohawk flooring which is currently on sale for about $1.60 per square foot. It's laminate, not vinyl, which is my only real hesitation. It looks nice though, is very thick (12mm), has pad attached to the bottom, all of the things that matter when looking for flooring. 

Would it be a huge mistake to use this in a basement? I am anticipating putting a vapor barrier (plastic sheeting) down between the concrete and the flooring, but the attached pad will save me from that additional cost. The basement is dry - we get some humidity in the summer but that's handled by a dehumidifier that runs as needed to keep it at 45-50% and drains into a sump pump. In the winter the humidity hangs out at around 30%. We have HW baseboard heat down there and in the summer we use a portable air conditioner (the kind that looks like a dehumidifier and vents through a hose out the window). 

If money wasn't a consideration I would definitely go for LVP, but since money is a thing and this is a pretty large space, I am having a hard time passing up what seems like a really great value.

In terms of priority, waterproofing is critical since the flooring is intended to be continuous. I prefer loose lay, no bevels, and a softer feel to walk on.

Gutters are fine.  But I noticed some moss growing on my shingles.  Is that a problem?  I see other houses with that.  I'd assume it's not good to have crap growing on your shingles.  It's only going to wear them out and let water in more.  So how do I get rid of that?  Maybe some bleach and water poured over it and then hosed off?  Enough to kill moss but not harm the shingles too much that way?

It looks moss.  Then when I took the pic it looks like there's some other ""barnacle"" crap growing on there.  The pic brought that out more than it actually looks like.  But there's some other stuff on the shingles.

There is a little tree next to this section of roof.  Someone planted one years ago and didn't factor in when it would grow more.  And that future time is now.  I cut back a few branches on it.  I could cut the tree down myself.  It's not a bad looking tree, and it does provide some shade in that area which is nice.  It's just a little too close to the house.  This section of the roof would still get some sun though.

I believe the roof is due for new shingles in a few years.   Maybe it was reshingled in 2013 or 2014.  I'm not sure.  Although someone told me the roof looks ok, and I don't need a new roof until the shingles have really gone bad.  They said the roof is perfectly fine now.   When I mentioned this moss, they said to get rid of the little tree near it.  I could do that, but there's still this stuff growing on the roof.  

I'm also planning on doing a house wash and gutter wash this next year.  So if it's something simple like dumping bleach on this moss and growth, that's probably easy enough.


I'm also thinking of some weeds I killed in the cracks and some weed trees that were growing up.  I used vinegar, dish soap, and salt on those.  Just dumped it on straight out of the container.  That killed off the weeds right away and worked well.  So maybe that would work on the roof moss stuff too?  I would imagine vinegar and salt might not be as harsh as bleach.

I’ve been putting the project off because I’m worried about making imprecise cuts and measurements due to the angles on the tile.

Any tips about working with angled tiles where you need to cut across them in sometimes odd ways? Is a wet saw the right tool to use? Or would it be easier to use an angle grinder with a blade made for ceramic?

Also, the tiles have 1/16 inch spacers built in. I’m fine doing 1/16 grout lines given how busy the grout pattern will be, but are there disadvantages to using tiles with built-in spacers? 

To be clear, this isn’t my first tile project. I’ve done one other, but it was with rectangular tiles and much simpler.

Thanks! Here are some photos of the pattern and the two basic types of cuts that will be needed on the tiles.

1086,arpanj2,RePipe whole house,"Hi All,

I am in San Jose, California, USA planning to get my pipes changed from Original fitted Galvanized pipes (1960's installation) as its getting rusted internally! I was thinking on going Copper initially, but i am heavily inclined towards C-PVC or PexA. 

Option A: Copper is good but Copper is getting more and more expensive and difficult to repair as I don't have the tools

Option B: I was thinking C-PVC  mainly as its easier to fix (if it leaks) and a lot easier to maintain - plus very easy to do with Water Circulator system (2 story house kills you with Water bill waiting for hot water). The design can be branch and loop over here.

Option C: I recently discovered PEXA - which is much easier to install esp if you get the right sizing. I was thinking 3/4"" main PexA and then combined with 1/2"" branches (just like C-PVC) - I haven't seen these designs though being shared. Most of them are either with Manifold systems or make-shift manifold systems. Is this setup possible?

It would be great to see some advice from the DIYers and plumbers on what they think is good option? I may do it myself or hire a plumber - but thats a discussion for another day :)

1089,turboshoes223,Converting home into rental,"Hi,

I have a small home in southern California so don't have brutal winters.  I anticipate moving in the next 6-12 months out of state, and the plan is to keep the home and rent it out for at least several years.  Walkable access to new mass transit is likely in the next few years and the mortgage payment and rate are good, rents should more than cover mortgage plus upkeep.

Being quite handy, I'm looking for things I can do in the coming months to renovate/improve things to make it a) more efficient and b) less likely to need repairs.  Given that I'll be out of state, that would mean hiring people for every repair, so I'd rather put some money and sweat equity in now if that reduces the chance of having to have a pro come in when I'm out of state.  The home is small (900 sq ft), 2 bedroom and about 100 years old, plaster &amp; lathe walls, but fairly solid in most respects over the last 15 years I've been here (so when I say something is 15+ years old, all I really know is it pre-dates me).  Would love any feedback on things to consider doing (or not doing) in the coming months.  Temps are fairly moderate (low of 30s-40s in the winter, 90's in the summer), no A/C and only a single wall-mounted heater in the hall.  A/C isn't really needed other than 2-3 weeks a year, but the home does get cold in the winter so I often use a space heater in the living room to supplement the current wall heater.

* Insulation:  I'm currently installing a vapor barrier and soffit vents in the attic and will then add some more blown in cellulose (currently about 3-4"") once that's done.  Windows are double paned, at least 15 years old but seem to be adequate.  Walls and floor have no insulation, but some research says insulating the walls may cause more problems than benefits.  Considering insulating the floor if it would be a big help.  I've sealed the outlets and such already.  I have a thermal camera so have fixed most of the air leaks, but the wall cavities show up as blue compared to the ceiling.
* Heater: Has an old gas wall heater (3-4' tall, wall mounted) in the hall that heats the entire home.  Don't know the age, but at least 15+ years old.  No thermostat other than the dial on the bottom of the heater, but that means can't do any sort of electronic thermostat (i.e. reduce temps at night automatically) with the current setup.  The living room gets chilly as the kitchen is between the wall heater and the living room.  
* Water heater:  Tank water heater is 15+ years old, so will probably replace that as a preventative measure.  Looked at tankless, but doesn't seem worth it.  Current unit is gas and located outside (in a metal cabinet enclosure), leaning towards replacing it with another gas tank heater but add some insulation around the new tank.
* Pipes are copper, wondering if switching to PEX is something I should consider?  Again, no current problems with the existing pipes but they are 15+ years old.
* Roof:  Going to have a roofing company come out and take a look, current one is 15+ year old 3 tab asphalt shingle roof.  Had one minor leak a few years ago, but I replaced a few shingles and all good since then.  But it's probably coming up to the end of it's life.  I redid the gutters a few years ago as it was no longer draining properly, guessing due to settling/roof sag.  With a laser level I found one end of the roof is about 1.5"" below the other end, and the drain was on the higher end.  Rehung the gutters to get proper slope and it drains well now.
* Sewer:  We have a 12 ft tall tree in the backyard that I'm guessing has gotten roots into the sewer line (I believe it's clay pipe).  I use RootX every 6 months, but I still need to clean out the sewer line with a sewer snake (that I rent from the big box warehouse) every couple of years.  No real problems other than that, but wondering if it's worth proactively replacing the sewer line (or line it inside)?
* Sprinklers:  Have both front and back yards on an automated sprinkler system that I put in about 12 years ago, do I proactively replace the sprinkler valves?  
* Electrical:  I had the old knob and tube wiring replaced with romex when I moved in, but the fuse box is 15+ years old and there are some non-current code issues (e.g. a bathroom light and outlet are on the same breaker as the washing machine, dishwasher and disposal are on the same breaker, etc).  No real issues as far as blowing breakers or anything, but thinking it may be worth having an electrician replace the fuse box proactively.

They are in relatively good condition so I don't want to strip back to studs and drywall. At some point, I am guessing the 50's tile was put up to about the 5 foot level. I am guessing the 50's as I can tell the tile is a light blue, a very 50's color. I sort of like the color and think it will go well with a nautical theme I am planning, unfortunately it has been painted white. I am relatively sure it is a latex paint and only one layer. 

Do any of you fine folks have experience removing paint from tile? I have read some articles that discuss three methods:  scraping with a razor blade, heat gun, and paint stripper. I am a little leery about using a razor blade as the tile is colored and if the glaze is scratched the white will show through. With a heat gun I am concerned about popping the tiles off if they get to hot, I have used a heat gun on wood before with very good results though. As to paint stripper, I haven't used paint stripper for probably 20 years and that was some nasty stuff for oil based paint.

Our house was built in 1932 and it's time to replace the original 90 year old tin roof with a shingle roof (metal is too expensive and not worth it for the resale value given the neighborhood we're in). We're looking to [add a shed dormer to the second floor on the back half](https://imgur.com/a/8PRbhhk). 

Some specifics: we're in Richmond, VA, the house is 30' wide by 40' deep, there are [two bedrooms upstairs currently](https://imgur.com/a/KTf5ZO8) (one on each side) that are about 14'x12' with a small 9x10' dormer in the center of the front. Due to the angle of the roof, there's an [additional 8' of depth that's walled off and is uninsulated and unused](https://imgur.com/a/K6Gg2wE) on the second floor that runs the width of the house in the back. As you can see from the photos, there's HVAC ducting running from the unit in the basement up through the first floor to this exchange, where the HVAC for the two upstairs bedrooms and the two bathrooms on the back half of the house on the first floor.

What we're hoping to do is find a contractor who can take the tin roof off, raise up the back half into a shed dormer, take out the HVAC conduit in the pictures (we're going to install a mini-split upstairs later on and the downstairs HVAC can be routed through the basement like the rest of the first floor), take out the existing walls and ceiling on the second floor, divide it up into 3 rooms\* and a half-bath, and put a new shingle roof on with insulation. We don't necessarily need the rooms upstairs finished; we can do the drywall and painting ourselves.

\*By my math, with a 4' knee wall, we could add an additional 5' of depth to the existing rooms. That would give us two smaller rooms on one side of the house to use for offices and a larger room on the other side to use as a guest room/workout room.

I've never tried to tackle any kind of project like this and am totally at sea as to where to start.

1. The dryer vent is not properly installed/connected in the laundry room and attic. Lint was noted on the insulation around the vent. This can allow the moisture of the dryer to be deposited into the attic and potentially damage the structure.  A qualified contractor should be consulted for repair.

2. Water Heater: The TPR valve (TPRV) on the water heater has a PVC type pipe connected to it. PVC drains are not approved for hot water use which can create a safety concern. A plumber should be consulted for repair.

I was away from my home for a few days and when I came back I noticed these spots on the wall of my linen closet. This closet is in basically the center of the house, and is not adjacent to any rooms with running water like a kitchen/bath. The spots are pink in color and a little less in diameter than the height of a dollar bill (pictured).

Hopefully the imagine link works (sorry never used it before).

I’m starting to try and refinish my basement on my own. I’ve laid down the Dricore subfloor and I will be putting up the studs soon. Before I do so, I was hoping someone could help advise as to whether or not I should leave this insulation up on the concrete walls. It’s nailed/anchored in directly to the concrete, and I think it’s there to prevent condensation mainly? (I’m in southwest Ohio and the house is a new build… about 6 months old). I’m planning on putting the studs up about 1” away from the concrete walls, with the plastic sheeting on the back to enable me to place insulation between the studs. 

My main concern with the insulation that’s already up now is future cracks leading to future water/moisture exposure and mold. However if I was to get rid of it, I’d be worried about the potential condensation. The building foreman told me to leave it up, and there is a tar water/damp-proof coating on the outside; but looking for the advice from someone else besides the foreman since of course they’d tell me to leave their company’s work as a CYA.

I couldn't find an exact replacement, but the $0.78 bullnose piece I'm holding will work...*if* I can carefully remove some more of the tile in a straight line.

For completeness of information: my replacement bullnose is the exact same width as the original tile, and if I can break off the original tile in a straight line from where the chipped off part ends it conveniently ends up being exactly the right height to match my replacement piece.

Google has told me an angle grinder is the proper tool for this task, however I am pretty sure I will cause more damage than good if I try to do that. I don't dispute it's the right tool for the job, I just doubt my ability to wield it properly. I would like to not cause further damage to the tile because I can't find an exact replacement piece and if the break goes up any further it will be taller than the tallest bullnose piece I could find. Is there another, maybe less potentially destructive, way?

Enough of a rant, here’s the question, how hard will it be to put a pad under this generator after the fact? I was hoping to be able to just get it suspended enough to pour under it and let the concrete set and place it back down. Anyone do this after the fact fix?

Hi all,

I currently have a doorway in a load bearing wall that was retrospectively installed (installed after drywall was put up). For whatever reason, it hasn't been built the way I would have done it (especially if drywall wasn't an issue) - one stud has been cut (to form a cripple) and the ""header"" has been installed more as a noggin/spacer between studs, instead of being on top of jack studs.

The studs are nominally 450mm apart - who thinks it is still structurally sound as is as it's only one stud has been compromised?

Current configuration and actual photo (some features not visible due to drywall):

[https://i.imgur.com/BtVRMQa.png](https://i.imgur.com/BtVRMQa.png)

In order to strengthen it up I'm thinking about cutting the ""existing"" jack stud and a new jack stud on the right hand side and then putting across a proper header that is supported from below.

This would decrease the opening by the width of a jack stud (45mm) so I would have to downsize and get a smaller door as well.

Current:
My home was built in the early 90's and runs on propane to heat up our water tank. Then the house gets heat from floorboard heaters. With propane prices and a 500 gallon propane tank, during winter, I have to refill every 2 months. During summer, it's 6 months. But every fill at 2.69 for 400 gallons, that's over $1k per fill.

We did re-do the nursery (paid a pro to install new carpet) but no other room could be easily cleared out, plus ideally we'd like to have all the rest of the flooring match when we eventually redo it. The closet though could be easily cleared out and I don't really care if it matches the bedroom floor.

What I was thinking - the previous owner left a bunch of spare flooring from the downstairs when she moved out. There is more than enough of the laminate that she used for the sitting room/dining room to do the closet (it's only like 6x6'). It's labelled ""glueless laminate flooring"" and as ""easy to install"" - I think it's the same stuff my godmother always called click flooring?

So basically, my question is: would it be feasible, in a weekend, to remove the old carpet and install this laminate? We've never done any flooring, although my husband is very handy and I think would have all the tools necessary except maybe a special knife to cut the carpet. I assume we would need to buy one of those metal bar things to bridge between the laminate and the bedroom carpet. Would we need anything to go between the subfloor and the laminate? General protips are also appreciated...",HomeImprovement,1645497117
1211,giozulu84,Need advice on fixing my floor,"Hi Everyone,

Was hoping I could get advice on a flooring conundrum I have. At the entrance to my house I had taken out a half wall to make the space more open. The problem is when I took out the wall it left an empty space on the floor and the previous owners did not leave any extra planks of the flooring for me to fill in. I've gone to a handful stores to try and find a plank that might fit and match the pattern but have been unsuccessful. I was thinking of just laying down some plywood, cutting it to fit the empty space, and then staining it to match. Does anyone think this might work or have a better idea? The dimensions of the floor board would have to be 3/8 depth, 5.5 inches wide and about 3.5 ft long. The floor looks like it is a tongue and groove engineered hardwood.

1212,taximan87,Trying to find reason for attic condensation - Sealing top plates of exterior wall?,"Wondering if anyone has an idea because I've been wracking my brain with this and am at a loss. I am in Quebec, and it's been a VERY cold winter - after a few weeks of an extreme cold snap (-20 C or colder), we caught a pretty warm day of around 0 C. Lo and behold the following day when I looked out the window, I saw around my windowsill a bunch of brown spots that had already dried. Looking up I saw that it did not come in from the window, but up above.

https://imgur.com/ZMaww36
https://imgur.com/YGMavY4

Took out my ladder and went to the attic, and I felt like I was in a humid rainforest, plywood sheathing soaked everywhere, wet spots on the insulation. I already knew my attic suffered condensation as I spent some time chasing out mice last winter, but the weather conditions this year made it such that it caused a leak for the first time we've been here in 4 years. Now the other thing is I got NO marks on drywall. It only came through the window. So the attic and wall vapor barrier seems to have done its job.

 My issue is that, most all boxes are checked when it comes to my attic and preventing problems:

- Plastic vapor barrier, installed above junction boxes and the like so there are little if any cuts. No pot lights.
- Blown in insulation, probably around R32, on top of vapor barrier. Not up to today's standards (2004 townhouse construction) but I don't think it's little enough to cause the amount of condensation I saw... but I could be wrong
- Soffits are vented. In my area they don't use ridge vents very much, but Maximum exit vents, with a model ample for my attic size.

Which brings me to my last point and title of this thread - my vapor barrier. When I went around checking the perimeter around the attic (above the windows that leaked, for example), I had insulation that was soaked through but BELOW insulation that was dry. So when I dug up some insulation the bottom layer was wet, which seems to be the obvious source of the water that made its way down. This insulation was sitting right on the 2x4 top plate of the exterior wall, and was about the ONLY spot in the attic where insulation was on bare wood and not a plastic vapor barrier. I have attached a pic - the horizontal red line is where my vapor barrier ends, which is right at the drywall of the ceiling, where it meets the exterior wall 2x4. However it seems to wrap around, and when asking the question to a contact in construction, he said it was normal that the vapor barrier 'turns' downward at that point, which creates the seal with the exterior wall. The part that I circled is bare wood 2x4 of the exterior wall top plate, which is wet.

https://imgur.com/I3RCkhW

I really don't know where to go with this, because I thought to myself, well I can maybe seal those bare top plates with spray foam. However, if heat is moving out, and up, from perhaps the window insulation instead (my room is freezing in the winter with a huge, probably poor quality window), would sealing the top plate simply move the condensation into the exterior wall, rather than making its way up to the attic?? The last thing I would want is to create worse problem than I'm trying to solve.

Anyway this is a doozy for me, and the kicker is we are a 15 unit townhouse association split into 3 rows of 5 - The default for some is to say 'increase exit ventilation"" however we are only ONE ROW of houses, of identical ventilation and in theory construction, that suffer this issue. We have black stained plywood from roofing nails, rusty roofing nails. The other two rows of houses are CLEAN! It's really strange. Another thing would be something caused by equipment, a neighbour in my row having a disconnected bathroom fan or something (all fans vent outside btw), but enough to affect 5 whole units?? There is some airflow between connected attics but really not much.

My LAST point of comparison is the direction of the houses in relation to the sun - our row runs east-west meaning our backyard gets BEATEN with sun, and the north facing side (where my bedroom is and where the leak happened) gets absolutely no sun at all. The cleanest row of houses in regards to attic plywood runs the same orientation, however the sun hits their front and the front side has less roofing shingles exposed at a very vertical angle - I'm wondering if the intense sun we get on a huge portion of roof has a way of exacerbating condensation. Although from what I read it should help to create air current in the attic if anything...

Anyway, I'm clearly trying to avoid calling a company that will 100% simply recommend a full re-do of attic sealing and insulation, but I'm getting to the point that I'm really, really not sure where to go with this.

Should I start by sealing those exterior wall top plates or would I regret that later?",HomeImprovement,1645496836

It's come loose in a few places, which is annoying. But also, I'd really rather have ""usable"" wall surface here, that I could put shelving up against, or even hang stuff on anchors. 

So my 2 questions are:  


1. How would I simply re-anchor this insulation to concrete?
2. If I wanted to replace this insulation with something thinner/more rigid, would I be sacrificing much insulation -- or worse, be in violation of some code/standard?

1259,Fortune-After,Adding a fresh layer of drywall over an existing wall to get rid of ugly texture and provide some soundproofing,"I have a small condo that I want to do some improvements on. One thing is reducing the amount of noise that transfers between walls. I’m not trying to build a home theater, just make it so someone standing in one of the bedrooms wouldn’t hear noise from the TV or people talking at normal volume. 

I don’t have a huge budget for this and even a modest improvement in the STC would be welcome. I was thinking of just adding a layer of 1/2” drywall to living room wall. I have read a lot about using Green Glue to act as a decoupling agent, but the price steep. I also watched a video comparing test results of soundproofing that showed some carpet glues can work just as effectively at a fraction of the cost. I may do more of this in the future and maybe more seriously, so this will be my first test run. 

What I’m wondering is since I’m planning to add drywall over the old wall with texture all over it, how much impact would covering the new drywall with glue even make sound-wise? Can Green Glue and similar products even be used over an old painted wall? The texture on the wall is about 1mm thick and has lots of gaps that will leave air pockets. I would guess maybe half of the surface of the new sheet of drywall would touch the old wall. I’m not even sure if the glue would properly cure and spread around, but would the open air pockets be somewhat effective on their own?",HomeImprovement,1645486026

The issue is that there are 2 big dips and overall the concrete slab is very uneven. I have measured the dips and the biggest gap is 3 inches. These dips are in 2 separate sides of the basement and from what I researched this would not allow for floor installation. I contacted a couple contractors but they would only do the whole project and wouldn't quote just doing the floor leveling.

I looked into self leveling concrete but from my research it should only be used for up to 1 inch depths (typically less). I also called several concrete leveling companies but I couldn't find one that does this kind of work.

I am looking for a method/product to do the the leveling, a flooring solution that can handle this kind of dips in the base or a recommendation (if allowed) for a company that does this kind of work (unfortunately looking for concrete leveling comes up with companies that level concrete slabs/driveways by pumping foam/substances under it). I would prefer any solution that adds as little as possible height to the floor, since the current basement height is 7'.

I'm attaching a link to a picture of the gap measured from wall to wall and a sketch of the basement with the dip location. Please let me know if you need any other additional information.

1273,space_ghosts_,Neighbors poor siding job causing leak to my roof below?,"I bought a house in the fall from an old couple who had been dealing with water damage upstairs on and off for years, but patching the roof themselves. I had a new roof put on all the way down to the decking, but one night during a heavy storm water started leaking in the same spot as the repairs done by the previous owners, but all the other prior moisture issues were gone. My roofers/siding contractors came back out and noticed the attached neighbor that’s taller had holes in their ensel brick siding above where we’re attached, missing patches, spots where the frame of their house was visible, as well as signs of patching with some sort of mud. Roofers didn’t see anything else on my roof itself, and said they were confident water was getting into the holes in the neighbors siding, running down to where our structures connect and through the path of least resistance into my ceiling. My insurance company came out, covered the damage from the storm to the interior, and also couldn’t find any spots on my roof that could be allowing any water in, and put extra caulking around all the flashing to be safe. The water is entering uphill from my chimney, so no flashing issues around that though. 

The neighbor was an out of state investor in the process of selling the house. They agreed to replace the siding and reached out to my contractors asking about “the cheapest possible fix because it’s just a rental” but they would only do the repair if a full replacement, so the neighbor hired his maintenance guy to do the work. He stood in the street shouting instructions to two young guys on the roof the whole time. A few weeks later we had another big storm, and my ceiling starts leaking again, but the sale closed and a new out of state investor owns the home. My roofers come back again, and without even going on the roof say the siding is one of the worst jobs they’ve seen and that’s still the problem. They go back up to check my roof and look at the siding, which was just applied right over the old stuff - Water barrier stopped an inch above my flashing (could see it in the gap between my flashing and the bottom of the siding), no counter flashing, seams lined up in spots, gaps between pieces, and whole rows not clicked together. Is it feasible for this kind of shoddy work to still be causing the leak? there was SIGNIFICANT patching to the siding prior before chunks just started falling off.

Issue 1: Water consistently pools along the concrete patio edge. I’m in Zone 5B, so the soil is frozen exacerbating the issue photoed, but generally this is a consistent issue. Initial thinking was to add a pre-formed drainage channel to collect the water (https://www.homedepot.com/p/NDS-4-in-x-10-ft-Speed-D-Channel-Drain-with-Grate-400-10RTL/205938053). I would drain this to a 3 foot dry-well in the center of the lawn, as the other directions all have mature trees &amp; I’m assuming I’d hit too many roots.

Issue 2: on the side of the house directly adjacent/connected, water consistently pools between a mature tree and the patio, basically a muddy patch for the dogs and kids 8 months of the year. Goal, add drainage/dry-wall and potentially dry-scape to prevent muddiness (word?).

Issue 3: our electrical, gas and cable utilities all run directly in between these two. I’m assuming so I can’t connect both of these to the same dry-well as I’ll hit the utilities. 

Questions:
- Can these be connected with the utilities in between, would they typically run them below the frost line?
- would running that drain right next to the patio, weaken the concrete? 
- Would it be better just to do a French drain or something else for issue 1 by the patio?
- can I just do a dry-well exactly where issue 2 is?

* I'd like to get a pretty sizable garage! with the space available I'm thinking probably an oversized two car, with one bay being extra long for a work space. L shaped maybe :)
* Probably thinking attached at this point? Unless anyone has any other suggestions!
* In the front of the house (left side of diagram being front), I have my office which I'd like to keep the windows unobstructed! I work from home and spend so much time in this room.
* Would not be apposed to refactoring / relocating / demolishing the bathroom in the 'middle' of the current floor plan. Its technically the master bath, but also serves as the bathroom for guests. Could work a new bathroom into these plans.

I spent some time looking at homes for sale in the area to look at ideas, but no one shows anything in the area of this dead space.

Here is a [rough graphic](https://imgur.com/a/bLEhCrv) I drew up over a photo showing where the dead space is. As you can see this style of home has a landing that exists between two floors where you enter the home through the front door. Apologies for massacred poinsettia pictured. 

The conflict arises due to an entry way closet. Part of the 2nd floor is taken for the closet space. Consequently, the space above the entry way closet is left dead. Interestingly, the space is accessible by the adjacent closet in that room, but you can see the dead space is quite a large space. While accessible, its not really accessible. Its a very deep and tall space. Additionally, we want to close ""access"" to this space so I can do a built-in in the adjacent closet. I need to close it in order to shelf up in that closet. The adjacent closet is not very functional with the dead space opening. 

So I am looking for recommendations for the space. I've played with the idea off opening the space on the entry way closet side and pulling out the accordion doors and making a built in entry way bench and coat hooks (very trendy now) that goes all the way up to the ceiling. Maybe too grand? The other idea I had was to open the space on the other side of the wall in that bedroom and making built-in shelves, but those would be some very deep shelves, nearly 25"" deep if I used the whole space.

 I had numerous conversations with them about the transition, but apparently they weren't listening and so what I have is an uneven tile to tile transition, which they initially put those thin metal transition strip in, but it has a quarter inch gap on one side (since you know, the transition is uneven), so we had them remove it.  

Now what I'm thinking is getting a wood reducer and using 
 a belt sander on the low end until it matches up, then using liquid nails to hold it into place.  Since they thought they could go with the thin metal strip, the gap between the tiles isn't enough for a typical transition.  I think the difference is too much just to grout it too.  Open to other ideas if anyone has any, obviously would prefer not taking those tiles up and cutting a proper transition gap.

1340,hellostarling417,Mystery Bathroom Leak- glue/water bubbling between floorboards,"Hi all,

I have a puzzling leak in my main bathroom, first discovered over 1 year ago where the glue from my floor planks was rising to the floor next to my glass shower and in front of the toilet. Nothing substantial, just one or two places with a line of about 3 inches of watery glue substance where the planks separate.

A handyman came and re-caulked the shower which stopped the sticky water patches for about a year. Covid has ruined my ability to measure time, but it was long enough to essentially forget it was an issue at all. It has recently returned. This time, I removed and replaced the caulk myself around most of the shower but left some that looked unaffected to see if it would solve the issue again. No such luck, and it's getting worse.

The glue bubbling/water doesn't appear immediately after using the shower- it takes at least an hour- sometimes multiple- where I'll go to sleep without anything but wake up to its presence. I don't think it's the toilet or sink because I'd see it more frequently. I've also determined it's not the caulking and now suspect the drain may be the culprit or the shower pan.

My question, I suppose, is does anyone have an inkling of what's going on? I will of course bring in a professional to asses, but I don't want to get taken for a ride and would prefer to have some detective work done with a guess or two as to what's happening and what might remedy the situation. 

It seems to not be a constant leak as the spots come and go after I wipe it up or they dry out, although they're a more permanent fixure as of late. For example, I haven't used the shower since Friday evening (I've been using a different shower) and some more appeared this morning... Which isn't exactly promising.

Here are some pictures of what the water/glue looks like in between the boards, and a quick drawing of the layout of the space to show where the water is appearing vs. where it could be coming from. The boards/planks are wonky from being pulled up to investigate.

1341,Jbutler21911,Help with sump pump situation,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a new first time home owner - I think I am having a sump pump situation and would like to ask for some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Context:  I grew up in areas where we had basements with sump pumps that were rarely ever used due to our locations on hills or were just high above the water table.  I bought my first home in a relatively flat area that must be much closer to the water table.  The house has no visible signs of water damage anywhere in the basement.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of the above, I did not know that there were steps to winterize a sump pump like leaving an air gap so that it doesn't freeze and burn your motor.  I heard the sump running for about 5 minutes straight and went to check on it....I tapped the rubber check valve outside the home (nice, idiot) and it exploded and all the water drained out fine and it kept my motor from burning.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I've seen that some people just put splash plates out during the winter to disburse the water away from the foundation so I attempted this (also tried a downspout extender) and have found that the grade is actually slightly toward the foundation.  After a small melt off in MI, it seems that the sump is just recycling the same water every 20-40 minutes and the ground is very saturated and almost has standing water against the foundation.  I would like to get on top of it before it causes any issues - does anyone have any advice on what I can do to mitigate the risk here?

1343,itoa5t,Need help having an acrylic diffuser make a 90 degree turn,"Hello all! I tried posting this on /r/DIY but it got removed. So a while back I did this project where I ran aluminum channels along the edge of the ceiling of my bathroom. Overall it turned out great and I'm really happy with it. 


Problem is. The aluminum channels came with acrylic diffusers. They look fantastic on the straight sections, but when I needed to make them turn, things got complicated. 

Doing convex turns was manageable. They're not as beautiful as I'd like, but they're absolutely passable. Unfortunately, there's one strange part of my wall that has a convex corner. That convex corner is the ugliest in my opinion. I tried using a Dremel to get it as perfect as I could. But it's just not right. Using the Dremel too long starts melting the acrylic, and not using it enough leaves rough edges that don't meet up perfectly.

Is there a way to bend this acrylic 90 degrees perfectly? Or perhaps is there somewhere online I can buy this already bent?

It will be perpendicular to the ceiling joists can I just nail the top plate to the joists and then nail the sides to the current walls (this is for the top of an enclave)or am I required to run a support to the floor? 

Backstory:
I've got an existing closet in a bedroom that is out into an enclave. The current interior dimensions are 68 W x 26 D x 96 high. It has two sliding doors that are 36in wide so they overlap some. The tracks are located on the ceiling and on the floor. 
The doors are old and flimsy so I'd like to replace those at minimum.

This enclave is actually 38 inches deep so there's really 10 inches of wasted space in front of the closet doors. I'd like to get that back and move the doors forward 10inches so that they're flush with the other wall.

My original thought was to get a pair of 36x80 bifold doors doors and then to trim those to fit. That'd be about a half inch off of each long side of the 4 doors which I would think would be okay. This would allow me to avoid building partition walls that would be required for 60 or 48 in wide bifold doors. This would still require me to build a partition from the ceiling down to 80 inches (roughly 16 inches).

I could also get bifold doors that are 96"" in stead of 80"", but it looks like those are roughly $200 a piece more expensive so $400 total. Maybe it's worth it to not have to do any drywall work as matching the knockdown texture has proven to be rather difficult.",HomeImprovement,1645467560

The plan: My boyfriend and I bought an RV and parked it on the property. We are going to live in it as we work on the house. The house is not livable as-is because it's filthy and full of mold. The air quality in there was abysmal. I was in there for less than an hour, wearing a mask, and I still had a sore throat for 3 days afterwards.

I'm not sure if it can be salvaged, at least not in a reasonable amount of time. The thing is, the house is paid off and our expenses living there will be quite small, just utilities and the RV payment basically.

The house did get a brand new roof just a few years ago, so it no longer leaks. The damage you see is from 15-20 years of leaking prior. I think the large bedroom, living room, and kitchen can be saved if we replace the floors, repaint the walls, and put a new ceiling in the kitchen. But the back part of the house is completely fucked. The small bedroom, bathroom, and hallway leading to them are destroyed and will basically need to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Is it even worth trying to work on this? The property is quite valuable, maybe 200K-300K as-is, but the housing market is so scary that I'm afraid to sell it because the average price of a house in my state is like 500K...",HomeImprovement,1645466060

Then I applied two layers of PPG Gripper primer, which adhered very well. After doing so there was zero discoloration in the primer whatsoever. 

I decided to pour a micro topping over the primer after it had cured for several days. The topping went on just as I wanted but as it dried I noticed a bunch of orange spots and staining coming up from the glue. 

I realize this topping is messed up but thought perhaps I could pour/paint epoxy over the topping and then try again…?
I don’t mind losing the 1/4” height if it will stop the staining from coming up. I realize I should have completely removed the mastic instead of trying to seal it. 

Does anyone have solutions to this problem? I would rather not jack hammer the topping off to remove the mastic if possible.

My big question is with regard to the existing framing lumber. The walls that are clad with pine board are ostensibly 2x3 but are actually 1.75x2.5. They are old sticks and in good shape. 

Should i carefully rip these down and rebuild the walls after foam-board is up, or should i frame out the walls with new 2x4 boards? Curious to know what people think.

Hello everyone, 

I would very much appreciate your advice, please. We are installing an ikea kitchen with the help of our carpenter and want everything to be as solid as possible. The peninsula on the picture is screwed on the wall and we have also glued 2 pieces of 2x4 on the floor with some silicone. The 2x4 are about 4 inches. We have also drilled the 2x4 from inside the kitchen cabinet. We used silicone since we preferred not having to drill in our floors.

The plan is to put a quartz countertop with a waterfall on the side.

Is the installation solid enough?

The contractor came back to knock out the punch list on some small areas, and they added a rounded edge (like the kind that goes on a baseboard), and then caulked/filled/painted it - but we think it probably looks worse than before.

1382,dontwannadietomorrow,How to truly make ungrounded outlets SAFE,"I just bought a house and about 60% of the home has grounded outlets. Kitchen and appliances do, basement apt is grounded. The remainder are not, and some are in areas where I'd like to use a gaming PC or music equipment (guitar amp and microphone, etc). Bathroom is ungrounded but has GFCI. 

I got an electrician who came in and said we could install GFCI on those outlets and that protects you sufficiently from shock / house fires. So we got money from the seller to cover only that. 

But now I'm deep in researching it (should have done this before) and I find a lot of people who disagree, that GFCI's could still result in you getting a nasty shock and your outlets getting disconnected often. 

And now I'm full of buyer's dread. Please help me.

1. Are they right that GFCI will.protect me and the home with my PC and music equipment usage?

2. One thought I had is that I could ground 2 outlets that are on the same wall as the breaker box. Same wall, that can't cost that much right? Any ballpark figure? 

3. Two electrician family members want to create a ground in each outlet by attaching a ground wire to a screw in the back of the outlet box that is connected to the home.

1383,schlinker,Bedroom sliding door help /suggestions,"Hey everyone see imgur link at the bottom for pictures of the door frame I am trying to figure out how to get a sliding door on.

We have a door frame into our bedroom that has a low ceiling due to hvac, the ceiling is only a few inches above the door opening. We don't want a swing door because when you open it swings into the room towards the TV (where the blanket ladder is in the pictures) and is just a blank white door so it looks bad and covers the pallet board wall. So I was thinking some sort of sliding fancier looking barn style door if possible. I know it would cover pallet wall when open as well but it would be a much better looking stained barn style door on a track instead of the current all white blank standard door.

A barnstyle sliding door would be our first choice however there isn't much room above the door opening so it would have to be some sort of low profile hardware kit and I am not sure how the track would work since it would be mounted to the white trim on the top above the opening and then what once you're passed the door opening over the pallet board wall since the white trim sticks out past the pallet board? If I got a new longer piece of white trim over the door and ran it on the pallet board wall to mount the track to where it slides when fully open it would look weird with a long white extended piece of trim right? Especially when the door was shut, but maybe not. So not sure what to do with the low ceiling and the running the track over the pallet board wall on a barn style door.

My other thought was a wall cavity sliding door, as the wall behind the pallet board wall is in our storage room, but not sure if it's even possible to get a cavity door kit in there since you would have to rip up the door frame for the new door location and the door frame into the storage room. Unless there's a way of doing this I'm not aware of.

If both of the above sliding options don't have a good solution I will probably just do a swinging barn style stained wood door.

1393,jsigmon91,Desperately Need Advice on Septic Problems,"Sorry this is going to be a long one.

***The Background***

I know very little about septic tanks so I'm just going to tell you what I know and what I've been told and hopefully someone here has seen a similar problem or is a septic expert!

We bought our home 2.5 years ago. From the paperwork that we have, a new tank was installed in 2017 after the old one caved in. The repair paperwork does not indicate that they replaced the drain field, just the tank. So my assumption, because I've seen nothing else to the contrary, is that the drain field is original to the house (1960's). 

**Ok, let's pause here. First, does this sound right? There is a permit for the tank replacement and a citation from the health department about it needing to be replaced. No mention of the drain field. Would the health department issue a permit to just replace the tank and not the drain field if the drain field was 45+ years old? Maybe if there weren't any problems at that time?**

On the map of the septic system, our drain field is just one long pipe (probably \~125'-150' long if i had to guess, though its not marked). And after digging it up, its a black ridged pipe (almost like those gutter drains people run underground. It is marked on the diagram as ""LDP"".

***How It Started***

Nearby where the drain field ends there is a smaller black pipe (about 2 inches wide) coming out of the ground and draining water down our hill side (house is built on a steep big hill).

For a while we didn't know what that black pipe was. It trickled water (never gushed, always the same amount when I would check) and smelled like sulfur. We had multiple people come out to look at it and were told it was not septic related. We tested turning on every shower &amp; sink in the house, let it run for a while to see if more water would come out the pipe. Nope. One plumbing company finally suggested it was just an old water supply line and we could put a cap on it. Which we did. The water trickle and the smell were gone, for about a year. 

***Return of the Stench***

The problem came back. Our yard near the end of the drain field &amp; that small black pipe was soggy and started to smell like sulfur again. I did some digging and found the end of the drain field and saw water pouring out the cracks in it. 

Had someone take a look at it and their take on the situation is this: The drain field is old and full. The ground just can't take anymore water because its too saturated so its coming up at the shallowest point (the ground is thinnest at that point, but drain field is still about 18"" underground). Someone who previously lived here must have had the same problem so they tapped the drain field with the smaller pipe and just let the water runoff onto the hillside. 

He said my options are this:

1. Dig a big hole, fill it with gravel, cover with dirt and drain the overflow into that (didn't call it this but I think he was describing a French drain?). **My concerns are this isn't up to code anymore and is a temporary fix (what he said) Wouldn't this need to be disclosed when we sell the house? Also, would the health department hit us even harder if they knew we installed it?**
2. Extend the small black pipe further down the hill to get rid of the smell so close to the house. **I know its already draining out onto the ground, but I'd feel guilty** ***actively*** **participating in septic runoff. Also, I'd hate our neighbors down the hill to have the stench problem.**
3. Install a charcoal filter on the end of the black pipe which should get rid of the smell. **This one sounds strange. Where would the filter tank go? Underground? Would the water actually be safe to drain on the hill or would it just help with the odor?**
4. Call the health department, they will decide how it has to be fixed but he warned me our property doesn't have much space for more drain lines so the fix may be even more expensive than it normally would be. **Clearly this is the right way to fix it.**

***Where Things Stand***

I cut the cap off the small pipe. Water was draining into our yard anyways so I thought it would be better to drain 5' to the left down the hill than make standing water.

I'm *typically* a play-by-the-rules kind of guy and also someone who wants to fix things right so I don't have to revisit the problem again in 5 years. But I'm also not thrilled about paying 10k+ and having the yard torn up.

**So here is what I want to know:**

1. If the health department comes out and tells me how to fix it, do they give you time to save up money if you can't afford it right away? What if you aren't able to get a loan/have the cash on hand?
2. Is there some other ethical/good-for-the-environment solution to buy us time?
3. Why can't the ground take more water!? Why isn't it draining off somewhere else underground? It's not like we are in a valley. We are up on a 85' hillside. 
4. Anything about what I've said sound not quite right? Just trying to fully understand the problem and what I can practically do about it.

I have solar companies calling or stopping in often and we have checked and we are in the 90% range for coverage on both sides of our roof. My MIL out solar on her house 10 years ago but I still can’t seem to understand how the billing works. 

My MIL definitely produces more power than she uses, by a long shot! I can’t understand how she still has to pay an electric bill every month on too of the service fees for the meter, on top of the “credit” that should be going back to the grid. I will also say that she doesn’t always think things through so I can’t say she didn’t get fleeced but if she’s producing roughly twice what she uses, I would tend to think that she should be getting g a credit somewhere along the line. 

My house would likely produce more than we will use also. Why do I have to pay for the panels, pay for installation, pay for the local company to read my meter and pay for electricity if I am out to g more back k to the grid than I’m using? 

Can someone explain this so I can wrap my head around it?

I may be totally wrong here but it’s that time of year, the salespeople are in the area daily.

1418,MKuin,Equalize a crumbly/uneven sand and cement screed floor?,"Hi there,

*(Please forgive any mistakes, English is not my first language and I'm not used to using construction terms!)*

Hopefully you can help us. We recently laid down a sand and cement screed floor in our kitchen. We're not very experienced with home improvement, but do our research well. Up until now, that paid off. We learned a lot and did quite well with other projects, to be honest. But this time, our inexperience shows. 

The floor is mostly level overall, but very uneven and quite crumby. Luckily, I think it's structurally sound. We used the S&amp;C screed to add some height. We want to lay tiles (15x15 cm/5.9x5.9 inch) on top of it with flexible tile adhesive, so the tiles are level with the adjoining (wood) floor.

**The details:**

* The S&amp;C screed floor covers an original concrete floor;
* There's underfloor heating embedded within that concrete floor. The pipes are secured with a layer of flexible tile adhesive (only in the milled slots); 
* We prepped the concrete floor underneath with watered down sand and cement mortar and immediately laid down the thick S&amp;C mortar on top of it;
* We compacted the first layer well, but the second layer (to get everything level) didn't ""take"" as well.

In hindsight, we should have used wooden beams to level the floor with, but we didn't, unfortunately. Being tired at the end of the day, we just finished it as best we could and let it dry. 

**Now we're left with what I can only describe as a pockmarked and crumbly surface:**

[**Overall floor**](https://imgur.com/esZs5ou)**,** [**closer up**](https://imgur.com/WW7z9q3)**,** [**close-up**](https://imgur.com/6UWNI8g)**.** 

Is there any way to secure that top layer (as best we can) before tiling with flexible tile adhesive? We'd remove anything that feels slightly loose before filling it up. We don't want to/can't add any more height, just fill in the holes and secure any leftover crumbly bits, so the tile adhesive has a solid surface to cling on to.

I really hope you can help us! I realize removing the screed and starting over again would probably be best, but we don't have the time or money to do that...

Thanks in advance!",HomeImprovement,1645457553
1419,Cows-b-Lurking,Cleaning gross old kitchen cabinets/drawers,"We recently bought a house built in 1977. It's in decent shape but the kitchen cabinets are well, gross. I think they are the originals and it shows.

He wasn't worried about it (I know it sounds like sales talk, but the guy really seemed good and spent a lot of time going back and forth with me on measurements and pictures).

  
We ordered windows that are a little larger than my current indoor rough openings, because the outside rough openings are larger vertically than the inside, due to the slanted sill... Because of this, WindowEstore rep said I'd have someone outside the opening, to pass them the top of the window from the inside, and then place it into the frame like that.

-LED or LED compatible (some of the sensors don't work with LEDs like the Rab basic flood models)

1462,AnymouseAlice,Advice on tool for cutting hole in ceiling for ceiling light,"I have a lot of experience dropping NM-B (and coax/cat6) from attic in remodel jobs but thus far always through walls.

In one room we are installing a ceiling light. I have access through the attic. Have the ceiling junction box with adjustable arms to bolt to joists, it's rated to support ceiling fan but we are only installing a light.

Plan is to drop 14/2 NM-B through wall to an existing outlet for the power source, using load side of an AFCI/GFCI to comply with code (all new wiring runs have to be behind one or on an AFCI breaker but we haven't upgraded breakers yet) and then drop 14/3 NM-B through wall to intended switch (smart LED dimmer switch so it needs the neutral, can't just use white as return)

What I don't know is if there is a proper tool to cut the hole in the ceiling wallboard. Could just use a wallboard saw but that would be a rather jagged hole. Is there a hole saw I can put on a drill specifically for this purpose with low risk of cracks?

I'd prefer to cut the hole from the attic so I can easily make sure the arms of the junction box properly adjust to accommodate the hole location.

Also, tempted to drop 14/4 to the switch location instead of 14/3 just in case a future resident does want a ceiling fan there (10 foot ceiling) since the junction box I bought supports the weight of a ceiling fan.

Is it better to do 14/4 or just drop two runs of 14/3 for that purpose? Obviously 2-gang old-work box for the switch because a separate switch would likely be desired.",HomeImprovement,1645437858

We'd like to redo the piping near it to install those valves so we can do proper annual descaling maintenance, and I'm ordering some parts now.

Is there anything particular to keep in mind when doing this? If we are going to the expense of redoing that piping - we'll probably call a pro given we lack the proper tools for this particular job - are there things we should install at the same time, like a water softener or pre-filter? We're on municipal water.

Also, in our unit, there is a filter located in the cold water intake. As a result, the manufacturer recommends installing a flexible steel pipe on that intake, so you can pull the filter more easily for cleaning. Is there any issue with having a flexible steel pipe in between the service valve assembly and the heater on the cold side? I can't think of anything, but wanted to see if I might be missing anything. And if that is fine, does anyone know if a hardware store or online store sells a 3/4"" steel pipe that goes male to female, or an adapter to allow that?

I’ve posted this twice in two forums because I wasn’t sure of the best place to put it.

Bit of context Last year I rented my house out to a tenant and gave permission to sub-let which he unknowingly did to an individual who used it as a marijuana farm. He agreed to sort out the damage, did some then didn’t do the rest.

Not sure if you guys have seen a weed house, but there are large ventilation pipes that they put through the ceiling. This left large holes in the floors and ceilings. 


To repair the ceiling, a metal sheet was placed to completely patch the hole, then wood was put over the whole ceiling to enable the plaster to go on, because without it the house was too damp for the plaster to stick. On the floor for the place the hole went in the floor above, a 12mm piece of wood was placed to cover most of the hole, with a 9mm placed on top to cover the remaining small parts around it.

On the other hand, our neighborhood is extremely wooded, it looks good.  We also get a ton of sun during the day through these windows.  So I'm not really trying to cover these windows up too much.  Ideally if I don't want to wave at people walking their dogs, I'd like to just have some ""light filtering.""  Best I can tell, during the day is that most of these will be provide significant privacy and someone would have to more or less be AT the window to see what's up.

My hope is at night, if I'm just running some colored hue lights on the ground (not the house being full on lit) to have enough privacy that I'm at least at ""not subscribed to HBO"" level privacy.

House is 100 years old, although prior to moving in the plaster was gutted out last spring and appears to have been replaced with traditional framing and drywall. 

Prior owner did a sloppy job in some areas (see: top of this door) and I've had to recaulk a lot of crown molding where their caulk cracked. Guessing that's due to the very low humidity (it's also winter and windy as hell) 

This is the first I've seen *drywall* cracking.  Any reason to be concerned or should I just fill it with some joint compound, sand, paint and call it a day?",HomeImprovement,1645409721

I moved into a house with what appears to be all new appliances about 6 months ago. I've noticed that there was grease building up on the cabinets above the stove but it just hadn't been high enough on my priority list to deal with until now. 

&amp;#x200B;

The hood is a GE 30"" (JVX3300SJ3SS). Here is an album showing a couple pictures of the set up : [https://imgur.com/a/QVUzAEe](https://imgur.com/a/QVUzAEe) . The hood is vented outside of the house and the flap to the outside opens when the fan is turned on. However, the vents in the front of the hood (and oil on my cabinets) suggest that it's recirculating and not venting outside. There is no baffle that I can see to prevent air flow from going out the front of the hood instead of the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to force the air (and oil/grease) out of the house given that the hook up already exists. Is this something that's fixable with the current hood or something someone has seen before?",HomeImprovement,1645409529

1508,whytemyke,Repairing A Fireplace Hearth,"Hi all! Hoping I’m not asking something that’s overly redundant. I searched and didn’t see anything about this. 

Basically on the house I purchased last year, I’ve got a fireplace. The fireplace is raised a little bit off the floor (maybe 18”) and underneath it is a floating stone slab used as a hearth. The slab is about 6-10” off the floor with the carpeting beneath it butting up to the brick of the fireplace wall. 

My problem is that I’ve got a nice crack going down the middle of that slab, from front back to the wall.

Is there a specific way to repair the crack in that stone slab? Is it just as simple as lifting it enough to close the crack, throw some glue in there and refinish the surface? I’m not super experienced with DIY stuff yet so I don’t want to jump at an obvious answer and have it be wrong or just screw my up further later on down the road.

This is a long shot, but I though I'd post here to see if anyone has any insights. I'm currently living in an old stone house (built in the 1700's). I'm renting, but would still like to see if there's anything I can do about this problem...

There is one room upstairs that smells like urine. The story is that the woman on the third floor of the house used to have dogs that only lived indoors and peed on pee pads - we think in the room above that room. The smell has soaked into the subfloor and as a result - into the ceiling of this room. 

My landlord has done a substantial amount of work to try to get rid of the smell - they painted and sealed the old stone fireplace, ripped out the drop ceiling, and sealed the underside of the floors (my ceiling) and wooden beams in the room with several coats of smell sealing paint (the guy who did the work has successfully gotten many smells out of old homes in the area). 

Next on their list is to sand the floors in the room in case they have soaked in the smell, or something. Though I'm not sure how effective that will be. 

I'm paying a lot of money to live here, and would desperately love to be able to use this room in the house, but the smell needs to get a bit better before I will risk bringing anything in or spending much time in there. Moving is not really an option right now, so don't give me that advice, please!

I understand labor and costs are sky high now, but my real issue is getting a response from any of the contractors I've contacted for quotes. So far, only one has come out. He seemed pretty reasonable, but then again I have no idea. 

So his suggestion was to add a patio initially, then enclose it later as it would be less expensive to enclose an existing space, per him. He said he could save me a few grand if we did it this way (something with the permits?), and it would be easier on my budget wise. He quoted me about 15k for a 20x 20 screened in aluminum porch, which is oddly what I guessed, but to get started, the quote for the patio would be $6,100, including labor for installing an exterior door, where swindow is. Is this reasonable? 

I don't want to stay in this house forever, but I understand there is a 75% ROI on adding a porch- plus it will make the space so much more functional even if I only stay a few years.

1574,itmesara,Would you insulate interior walls and any advice on this bathroom update.,"I am in the process of starting a bathroom remodel. Will be removing old, damaged wood paneling and replacing with something else, replacing floor and likely part of subfloor due to a shoddy linoleum install by previous owner combined with no ventilation. It’s our only full bathroom, about 6’x5’ floor space plus the tub in an alcove. This is also the only room in the house with no windows, it’s in the center of the floorplan. 

All the plumbing goes through the floor for sink and toilet, idk the that’s relevant. The wall facing the hallway has the door and foot of tub, toilet is facing the door, sink is across from tub - so each wall has an unmovable (without a pro) fixture. 

One of my concerns is that when anyone is in the bathroom, it’s loud, even with the exhaust fan we put in. Another is moisture from shower - even with the fan it gets incredibly steamy in there during showers. Would insulating the walls before I replace paneling help either of these? Would the cost outweigh any benefit? 

Also, what would be the best wall covering to go over the studs? Would Sheetrock be okay, with or without insulation to account for extra moisture? Is there something better for bathrooms? 

Last thing - we can’t replace the tub and surrounding tile in the alcove just yet. Will it be a huge PITA to replace walls/flooring then go back and remove the (cast iron) tub and crappily done tile later on? Anyone have experience with something like this?

I have a question about hanging floating shelves on some very thick drywall. These are hardwood shelves that serve as a bar and store various liquor bottles and glasses, and will weigh at most 20 lbs when loaded.

Here's my issue: I tried to drill a nylon self drilling anchor into the wall, and it broke. I figured it just needed a pilot hole, so I drilled into the dry wall with a 1/6 inch bit. To my surprise, the bit sank almost all the way to the drill tip before breaking through. I double checked and ensured I didn't hit a stud, which I had not. I turned to google, and haven't been able to find much on how to work with drywall this thick, and the anchors I've found to buy don't appear long enough to actually punch through this thickness of drywall.

So basically, I used very long structural screws to attach the shelves to the dry wall, and they seem to be holding just fine for now. However, I would like to anchor these to make sure that they don't pull out of the wall and cause some fairly decent bourbon to crash to the floor.

I recognize this is weird, and it's an old house that had a bunch of renovations before we moved in. It seems like they used the thickest drywall they could throughout the house--I have no idea why.

House is from 70s, with updates in the 90s that were of low quality. Things like some insulation, HVAC including ductwork, garage floor, drop ceiling, some electric all need a solid revamp (HVAC is a must, all others would be nice to do soon). 

Then in the 2000s previous owners expanded the house with solid quality work with very good materials. This need touching up now as it's about 20 years old -- but no substantial replacing. Still, lots of small jobs -- refinishing cabinets (that we'd rather not replace as they are good quality, but scuffed up a bit), refinishing doors, replacing or fixing some doors and stairs, replacing some light fixtures (for style), etc. Some of these I have learned to work on recently (e.g. I can probably do light fixtures) but there's tons to do and we're happy to call hire out some of it. 

Many of these jobs are not urgent, but would make us appreciate living in the house more. Overall, though, as we all know, contractors are hard to get now, and it's unclear who to trust. Lots of mixed reviews online or among neighbours word-of-mouth (some have good experiences, but plenty don't) for every single job, and we have tons of jobs that includes a broad range of skills. We've started separately calling HVAC, carpenters, plumbers, etc.

Is there a service that can coordinate all this for us in a way we can trust? Is what I'm looking for a general contractor? architect? Home consultant/inspector? I keep hearing that serious general contractors won't take jobs nowadays unless they're above a certain sum like $50k (which we might be willing to do if it takes care of enough jobs, but it's hard to estimate).",HomeImprovement,1645387970

We’re renovating our basement and putting the main bedroom down there because  it’s cooler and darker. 

Originally there was drop ceiling with foam tiles (pic 2), but we plan on drywalling. So right now I have open ceiling access. 

So I end up with a lot of tiles as garbage. In the interest of reusing instead of dumping in a landfill, I thought about maybe reusing them to help dampen sound between the floors.
The other reason I’m curious about this is that I work nights so I’m asleep during the day. Meanwhile my partner is working from home and often has loud zoom meetings. 

There are no wires or plumbing in this section of the house. There is a short (~5 foot) section of pipe for heating/cooling, but that looks easy to work around (picture 1). 

I know there are better ways to dampen sound or soundproof, but I figure, I have this material, so why not give it a shot?
I’m thinking I could even double or triple up the foam since I have the space. 

Anyone have any input on this idea? Or ever tried it? Is there a good reason I shouldn’t do it?",HomeImprovement,1645387383

1628,Author_37,Total noob - making door jambs for soundproofing (and later building or buying solid doors),"Hello, I'm new here and I have never made a door jamb before, much less make anything for soundproofing. My questions are mostly about the thickness of the door jamb and how to make the most solid soundproof structure. (if you would like any pictures or additional information just ask!)

Currently, our door jambs are the ""premade sandwiched together type"" they are busted and broken and need replacing, so my main goal is to replace them with much better material that is sound blocking and preferably cheaper than ""premade"". Currently, the gap (of hollow space) between the house's rough door frame and the premade door jamb is just over 1 inch on all three sides and is hidden by the trim, of course. but the amount of sound that comes through is so high. I can clearly hear talking and tv sounds; I might as well just have the door open at this point.

My idea was to buy thick enough wood to fit properly to the door and leave just enough space in the rough opening to shim the door in place. the issue is, the wood at my HD is either too thick or too thin. The wood they say is ""1 inch"" is really 3/4 inch ... and the wood that they call ""2 inches"" is really 1 3/4 inch. So, I'm at a standstill. I jumped the gun and bought the 3/4 inch thick boards (Pine) (but I can return them if needed, I haven't cut any yet.) I paid 49.88 per, and I can't really afford much more, $11 per would be my max (as I need 5 8ft boards).

But If I go ahead with this wood (3/4 inch thick Pine), the gap will be 1/4 on each side, should I fill this gap with something to soundproof it? like soundproofing rubber, or perhaps more wood? and ... how much of a gap should be at the bottom? I know online it says 1 inch or more but I want to get a threshold to seal the door and make it more soundproof, so I was thinking maybe only leave a 1/4 or 1/2 inch gap, and that's how thick my threshold will be. But I'm not sure, how should I do this properly for the best results at a budget-friendly cost?",HomeImprovement,1645380896

1651,desertfl0wer,Window replacement?,"tl;dr: Sunrise Vangaurd 6 windows for total 9k? Maryland. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone -- I'm a new homeowner and honestly not sure if we should get our windows replaced or not. Townhome built in early 90s - we have 8 windows. Doesn't seem to be any leaking, there is some temperature differences standing in front of window (can feel cold air slightly). Biggest issue is some windows start to slide down when opened instead of staying up which really sucks for springtime breezes.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway we had someone come out of a quote (he was here for several hours with a demonstration) which was very overwhelming honestly. We were able to get the price down from $13k  for 6 windows to $9k for total price of 6 windows (one is a big slider window replacing 3 individual).

&amp;#x200B;

The price is total for installation, taxes, etc. We have 5 days to back out of the contract penalty free but were basically told we needed to make a decision asap or we wouldn't get the deal. The brand is sunrise vangaurd windows and wouldn't be able to happen for at least 4 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure the price is worth it. Our energy bill for January (coldest month) was under $140 for our all electric home which seems cheap for our area in central MD from what everyone has been saying lately. Noise reduction would be nice, though, and some need to be fixed anyway.

The renovated section is older than 10 years and doesn't comply with the newer CO rules in this state, so I should replace those too.

So what I need is a bunch of new detectors, some wired and some wireless, that all interconnect. I also want them to be combo CO/smoke detectors.

Nest Protect ticks all the boxes except it's too expensive - I'd need a bunch of them and it just seems overkill to spend $1000 (or $800 or whatever) on smoke detectors.

There was about 2.5 inches of water covering everything. The water smelled like sewer water, and it came from the sump pump. The bedroom has carpet that was soaked and everything else is laminate. We moved the bed out the bedroom and cleaned the floors with bleach water. After that I slept in the living room a few feet from the soaked bedroom. I woke up Friday morning and couldn't stop coughing nor could I breathe well. I got so sick I nearly ended up in the ER. I'm an asthmatic with allergies to mold and mildew but I haven't had an asthma attack in years. I've been in a hotel since Friday evening without compensation for any of this.

Within the past 3 years, it had been modernised throughout, including making the downstairs open plan by removing a load bearing wall. There are building regs for this, and it is supported by a box lintel.

Around 1-2 months ago, we noticed a pre-existing crack in the ceiling get worse by splitting the paint open (previously only visible as a ridge in the paint. Last week, we noticed it had got worse, including by having a couple of chunks out (largest approx 8x3mm). It also 'sags' down - maybe visible by eye but easily visualised with spirit level (main part of ceiling in other areas in the room is level). There is a main crack running from our stairs towards the corner of the (mostly) removed wall, and then a couple of cracks (paint not split) diagonally across our hallway to the wall.

Should we be worried? And of yes, who should we call? surveyor, building engineer?

Pretty amateur at home improvement so if I muddle any details let me know and I can hopefully elaborate in comments or post. I live in a 650 sq foot apartment in Florida, for all intents and purposes our living room (and entire apartment) is a rectangle with 1 interior wall, 2 exterior walls, and shares walls and flooring with our kitchen. I’m hanging up a shelf I made that had its brackets spaced so that it would screw into my interior studs (had no problem with this whatsoever), but we moved around the living room so now I’m trying to move the shelf toward the exterior wall. 
A few issues so far:
Found the spot with my stud finder where I was going to drill my pilot holes for my shelf, 9/64 drill bit for #10 screws. I start going into my first hole and it makes it through (into the stud I assume) no problem. The second hole directly underneath clears the drywall but then I hit hard. I push a bit on the drill but its not moving at all. I figured I may have hit a screw or something so I move all my marks for my holes 1/2 an inch up. Same thing happens except for both holes. I try this a few more times with a variation of about 1/2 an inch each time. I moved my drill bit in and out of almost every hole and it was making a thunk (so it obviously wasn’t wood). 
I said screw it to fastening it to the stud so I just decided to put a toggler in about 2 inches to the left of my initial mark. I screw a half inch clearance hole and feel the same exact thing. I look in my hole and see what looks like a stone sheet about a half an inch behind the drywall. Couldn’t fit the toggler in the hole either as it was too long for the depth I reached.
Hopefully someone can tell me what I’m doing wrong or if I should just give up, thanks!",HomeImprovement,1645345538
1710,MrNerd82,Plan of attack on rotting back siding (TX-ranch style),"Hello HomeImprovement:

Wanted to get some ideas on how to best approach rotting back siding. Previous owner used cheap regular wood siding, and I suspect the window they had put in was improperly flashed/trimmed.  Been here about 8 years with it. I realize in the grand scheme of things this project is ""small"" when it comes to contractor looking at it, seems these days unless you are doing the WHOLE house they aren't interested. (everything else is brick)

https://i.imgur.com/wfEKsfL.jpg

Looking to replace that entire wall (approx 20') with either cement board, or engineered wood as well as have that window replaced/done right. (has a small hole crack in the exterior pane)

No stranger to working with either material, but the wildcard for me on wanting to hire it out is I'm not experienced or skilled with window installs, as well as the breaker box there properly securing/waterproofing the ins and outs around there. 

I'd be willing to bet once I (or contractor) started tearing into it, would find a rotted bottom plate in that area as well.  Haven't gotten quotes yet, but my biggest fear is for roughly 200 square feet of siding installed they will quote some crazy 5 figure price.  For a window, I'm cool with what I've seen around here mentioned, figure $1k for the window installed. 

Main goals are just having it done right in terms of flashing/waterproofing. I know cement board/engineered wood will last a helluva long time so it's a huge upgrade over what's there.  Insulating and sealing I can handle myself since I have no problem redoing the drywall and insulating from the interior side of things after all it said and done. 

Located in 75050 (TX) any thoughts and ideas are appreciated.  And I love doing business via word of mouth, so if you happen to have a name/number of a guy or local company I'm happy to take it.",HomeImprovement,1645343108

1713,jetsetninjacat,Should or can I seal this? Pre-insulation wall question.,"Hey experts. I am currently gutting my 1930 built brick 4 square American house in piecemeal. First the upstairs and then the downstairs after I move upstairs. I am very cost and enviromental conscience so I am looking to ensure that this project not only lasts a long time but also helps with cost saving from heating and cooling costs. I live in Pittsburgh so I have a variety of dry or wet weather at times from below 0 to almost 100F. 


This house was owned by one family until I bought it a few years ago. They had it repointed in the last 10 years. There are signs of old water damage from before they did this but in 4 years I have had zero problems. The walls of the house go brick-tar paper?-boards-framing with looks to be blow in insulation done in the 1970s-lathe-and plaster. I have gutted out the lathe, plaster, and insulation down to the framing. I am currently looking at doing spray foam insulation due to its noise reduction on top of the insulation factor(I live along a busy and loud road) before I put up drywall. When gutting i did notice a few spots in the old insulation that there was some moisture marks. The brick house was built properly with a 1 inch air gap between the brick and the wooden boards(see pic). 


Now my question as I am getting mixed results on the internet on this. Do I need to or should I put any kind of moisture barrier against the boards or seal the boards before the spray insulation? There are spaces in the boards leading to the air gap, do i need to fill these with something?  I know the spray foam seals holes, so is that enough to take care of this?


I am new to this and have some time as I am also having my electical completely redone before I start the insulation. So please feel free to correct me if need be due to my inexperience in the matter. I was going to do the spray myself but I may end up hiring a company to do it for me at this point as I consider this something I dont want to mess up.


Pics below. I am still cleaning up a few areas and so any insulation or plaster stuff you still see in the pics will be cleared up soon. The air gap also leads up the wall to the roof underhang vents.

1720,doc07b5,Cracks in stucco before job is complete.,"We are doing an extensive home addition...it is essentially a gut job down to studs, and doubling the square footage. We are almost ready to move back in, and I noticed today some hairline cracking at the corner of the windows and along verticals at the location of the studs nowhere near windows or doors. I can actually see a silhouette where the studs are through the stucco, which I wouldn't think is normal. OK. the complication is that we have a Tesla Solar roof. Now Tesla Solar sucks as a company, and their processes suck even worse. They insisted on installing the roof and powerwalls at the same time, which required that stucco be done before the roof went on. The GC was not happy about this, but we made a compromise:

1. We did the scratch coat first. Where they were installing the powerwalls we and added a brown coat and color coat . They had to make joints in the stucco, but it seemed like the best compromise.
2. Once they installed the roof, we waited a few weeks, and added the brown, then added the color a few weeks after that.

So clearly the roof load was added after the scratch, but before the brown and the color. I don't know that I can give the GC too hard of a time since he had to do things out of logical order as per my request(thanks again Tesla!!). With cracking showing up so early, and in locations not near a window or door, I think this is going to be a problem. I suspect that this is not only due to the roof load being applied after the scratch coat. I will talk to the contractor this week about it, but I don't know how strong of a stance I should take. Demand the stucco is redone? Ask to patch it and apply another color coat? Sue Tesla for being morons? (hahaha...good luck with that).

The cost from what I can tell is $5-6k, which is pricey but I can stomach it for a more comfortable home in these Midwest summers. What does the process of installation actually look like? Assuming a reputable company, will they need to tear up a bunch of walls and floors/ceilings to run the new duct work? Will they repair any drywall they need to cut into?

I am a complete idiot when it comes to handyman stuff, but when we bought we had a structural engineer come in and inspect the house before we bought it and we've corrected the issues he found. (For example, we had steel pillars placed in the basement to bring the house ""back to true."") Would doing that cause (for lack of a better word) ""unsettling"" to occur that could explain the cracks in the floor? They are on the edges of the room that was stabilized. 

I went into my basement and inspected everything from beneath, and I don't see any obvious weaknesses or cracks, but I do see where he used what looks to be plywood as the subfloor in a few places where it used to be plank subflooring.

It has no insulation and poor ventilation. About a year ago, we noticed some mold forming on the ceiling, which is painted wood. We had several roofers come out and there was nothing wrong with the roof itself, and all of them recommended installing fans to improve the ventilation. We cleaned up the mold and had a solar attic fan installed, which made a noticeable difference in the air movement in the room. However, the mold is back, in mostly the same places. Short of tearing down the walls and insulating the room, is there anything else we can do?

Specifically, I have seen a few articles on home improvement websites about mold-resistant paint. Does anyone have any experience with this? I can’t tell if it’s helpful or just a bunch of clever advertising. Any recommendations?

I took it apart to clean it, filled it back up with water, and then when I plugged it into an outlet at my sink (usually used for my microwave, so not the outlet I normally have it plugged into, but I just wanted to make sure I'd gotten all the gunk out of the pump reservoir), the little safety switch on the outlet - which Google tells me is called a GFCI - tripped, so the pulp wouldn't turn on and I couldn't use the outlet until I pressed the button.

Just for my own peace of mind and future reference... What normally causes this to happen? Does it indicate the item being plugged in may have some kind of electrical fault? The reason this is weird to me is that I normally have the pet dish pump plugged in at another outlet along the floor and I've NEVER had that outlet trip before. 

Could it have been because the electrical adapter got some water splashed on it while I was cleaning the bowl, and when I plugged it into the wall, the sensor shut it off to prevent me from getting electrocuted? (this seems super unlikely to me as I think I'd have noticed if the adapter was wet.)

The previous owner signed a lease with SolarCity, which has since been taken over by Tesla. To buy the house, I had to take over the lease, maybe 16 more years left. Tesla charges me $143/month, and even with the panels I was on track to owe SCE about $1200-1300 for the year. To further complicate things, we now have a sick family member who requires a lot of power-hungry medical equipment so our monthly electric bill has gone up an additional $200/month. I will submit a form to SCE to reduce the bill due to medical necessity, but it's been slow getting the doctor to sign the forms.

Anyway, the main reason I want a battery is for power backup. With crazy weather, we've had 2 blackouts this past week, and as mentioned, the family member needs electricity. More than a camping battery pack can provide. During the first blackout, SCE sent a notice that it would last til noon the next day, which was 16 hrs later. Thankfully power came back after 4 hours, but it was scary. Equipment has backup battery, but probably not for 16 hours.

The first battery I looked at was Tesla PowerWall, but seems like they're not installing that unless you buy new panels, so that's out. There are a lot of names that I'm not familiar with so I naturally gravitated toward brands I've heard of (maybe not always the right thing to do), like LG. Seems like a solid choice. I can get a 26% fed tax credit, so out of pocket maybe $6-7K. Are there are features of any one battery that sounds like it'll suit my needs better?

I have a 24' extension ladder that I was able to use to replace the siding on the back, but on this side you can see there is a gable roof that caps at 30', which puts the top few pieces of siding just out of reach.

I also want to put in a few windows and a new side door, as this side is completely baron and unused. My plan is to replace the masonite with vinyl. While doing some research I am seeing that you can just put house wrap over the masonite and install vinyl siding right over the top of that making sure to remove any rot. This would remove any of the major demo work. Is this method not advisable?

So I have a few questions:

1. Should I buy a 30' ladder or invest in a pump jack system, or is there something else I am missing?
2. If I install vinyl over the masonite, will this add complications to the new window and door installations due to the added thickness?
3. If I am attaching the house wrap and vinyl siding to the masonite, could it still rot off the nail and cause issues in the near future?

Nothing else in the bedroom, or on the same circuit, is having issues. I bought a touchless voltage detector and it indicated that there is indeed power going to the switches. I thought the switches might be bad so I replaced both switches today with two more smart switches that were tested prior by installing them to a hallway light.

The current shower stall is a fiberglass enclosure that has been stained since before we moved in and I'm eager to get rid of that mold &amp; mildew magnet.

My initial plan had been to rip the stall out down to the studs (I believe it's probably mount-to-stud anyway), install Kerdi board with a couple of niches (we have a _lot_ of shampoo and conditioner bottles, don't know why....) then tile that.  I was going to also install a rain head with a handle to switch between that and a wall-mounted hose-based head.

The more I investigate the Kerdi the more I think I am getting in way too deep and this project is gong to consume several months of my time.  I'm now wondering if I should just scale everything back, install a fiberglass enclosure, tile the upper wall &amp; ceiling only (over some Cement board), and call it a day.

My last major project was to rip off the drywall around the fireplace and install smurf tube to hide all the wiring for the TV / Stereo.  I also built a new mantel and a pair of stereo cabinets to finish it off. I've done tile before, with mixed results.  I always enjoy the _process_ of DIY, but when I tackle a project that most people would call a pro for, my satisfaction with the results is not always 100%.  I have the resources to get the tools &amp; materials I need to get the job done (for this project I would probably buy a wet tile saw).  What I lack is the experience of having done a thing dozens or hundreds of times like a pro would.

So, anyone who has tackled the Kerdi project, what do you think?  Am I overthinking this and it's really not so bad, or is it going to make me question my sanity at the end of the process?  If you think it's worth tackling, any resources that you'd recommend to improve both the planning process and the end result?  Thanks in advance!",HomeImprovement,1645304929
1834,randompittuser,Short duration whole house battery backup?,"I'm looking for recommendations for very short duration whole house battery backups. The power lines in my neighborhood are a bit iffy, and as such, we suffer many sub-5-minute blackouts during high wind, heavy snow, etc. I want to install a battery backup that realistically has the throughput to power everything in my house for about an hour. Assume I use 1.25kwhs per hour, and I'm on 200A service.

While attempting to clean my siding, trim, and clear out the gutters on my house, I noticed one end was hanging off, and the fascia it was attached to was very rotten. I got to it, and pulled the entire length of the gutter off and the fascia boards as well.

 [PHOTOS](https://imgur.com/a/D9oRueo)

Now that everything is off, I'm uncertain about how to repair/prevent this issue again. My plan is to:

&amp;#x200B;

**1) paint the rafters and edge of the roof decking to prevent further damage, and hang appropriately painted fascia boards as well.** 

**2) Hang new soffit vents, and the matching ""L"" shaped aluminum trim that covers the soffit/fascia connection.**

**3) Have a pro hang a new seamless gutter across the entire section of roof, and find some gutter guards that actually work.**

I'm unsure if anything else needs to be done, or if I am incorrect in my thinking of this being a simple repair. Any help is appreciated. The home was built in 1950 and is shaded under multiple huge hemlock trees. We also get about 100+ inches of rain in a good year, so I'd like to get this done right.

Also, the HVAC system is just not keeping up anyway (we have to use sooo much energy to keep the temp comfortable and can't afford it), so I'd like to get our ducts sealed to help. From what I can tell we have a lot of insulation but I need to get a professional to look at that too.

At the same time, we have all these solar guys coming around to offer us deals and packages because we have a very large south facing roof and could likely fit more panels than we need. So we're considering getting solar this spring, then replacing the furnace and AC.

Given the scenario what are my best options for AC and furnace? Gas is generally the favorite around here because it's cheaper, but if we go solar would it be better a better investment to get a heat pump which (to my limited understanding) would run on electric and act as both a heating and cooling agent?

This got me concerned, because almost every house I've lived in has had vinyl windows.

Not ten minutes later, a senior policy advisor from the EPA (a customer, I am in Washington, DC) comes in, and she tells me that this is a ""thing"", but that the worst thing about it is actually the smell, and basically expressed that modern vinyl windows wouldn't emit enough VOC's to really hurt a flea.

I need to replace our mirrored, front-hall closet, bifold door. It wasn't closing properly yesterday and when  I went to remove it, an entire side of it cracked in several places. My bad. 

We bought a new one last night, and of course the old track is not suitable for the new closet system. So this track will need to be replaced with the new track. Fun!  

Normally this isn't a problem. The top track was easily unscrewed, but the old track on the bottom of the closet door, has been glued or riveted (can't tell which, probably both) by the grip of a million angry gorillas. This is not coming off easily.

I remember that where I used to live, the bedroom doors were bifold, but they did not have bottom tracks. Just top ones. Admittedly though, they were wood. This is mirrored. I don't know if that matters?

Doing work that needs a permit?  Usually, only a specific part of your project needs permitting and inspecting.  If an inspector comes and work has been done in a large area then they will inspect all the work.

1925,DormantDormaus,Seeking advice/possibilities for hanging trailing plants in my skylights,"I have three skylights - one large one over my entryway, and one slightly smaller ones in each of my bathrooms.  I have been desperately wanting to hang some trailing plants up in the skylights, but I’m not really sure how to get started.  
  
I am kinda clueless but with some good pointers/suggestions, I think I can get going with this.  
  
My main idea has been to hang 2-4 dowels like you’d see in a closet, at different heights.  In that way, I could hang several plants at different places, and switch it up as needed.  I’ve seen the socket-type hangers which seem straightforward to mount.  I’m not sure if there are studs in a skylight, but I assume so.  
  
So I suppose what I’m asking is - do you have suggestions on more attractive ways to accomplish this?  Better options?  Things to consider?  If any measurements are important I will measure.  I live on the east coast of the US.

Some dimensions to help. Narrowest section of the hall way is 33.5"". This is between the base of the stairs and the wall. We could put a ladder in the front hall if the foot print is smaller than 82"" then we can expand out to 37"" wide. Ceiling is just over 17 high. 

We did get the cover off the ceiling to paint but the idea used there was not a preferred way...

Sorry about the washed out pictures. Panorama and the massive amount of light in the front hall is to blame.

1930,mfoo,Need help with options for replacing blinds with wide curtains,"Hi all! My partner and I moved into our first apartment this year and we've been slowly making it more cosy. We've left the most daunting bit to last and I'm here to ask for help with options. We have a wide balcony window consisting of three unevenly sized panes and we'd like to replace the blinds with curtains to round out the room with more texture. The current blinds aren't cosy at all and I've had to replace one of the draw strings that snapped (after attempting to repair it multiple times) and one of the left-hand brackets whose hooks sheared off.

For reference [here's a photo](https://i.imgur.com/VTQuF1G.jpg) (wide angle, sorry). The entire window is 330cm wide with the blinds being left to right 112, 124, and 93. There's 60cm of wall to the left of the window and 12cm to the right.

One problem is that there's not much space on the right, so we need a curtain pole that doesn't have decorative ends otherwise we're going to lose a bunch of light where the curtain sits while it's open as it'll obscure some of the window. We've found [this pole](https://www.polesdirect.com/product/28mm-allure-classic-brushed-gold-end-cap-curtain-pole-curtain-pole?queryID=294345b1e7f83a8bf7b20de7345f0eb3) which looks like it'll do the job (360cm version). It seems all poles of this length come with a middle bracket though and there's almost nowhere to put it - is it safe to hang the middle bracket from the ceiling? The one it comes with won't do that, do they have any specific requirements? I'm concerned I would accidentally tear the plaster down. Alternatively is there some kind of bracket that would fit to the wall? My stud finder suggests there's metal behind the small bit of wall above the window.

So, my questions are:

* Is it safe to hang a middle bracket from the ceiling?
* Do poles or brackets have weight ratings? The one I found didn't, but I imagine I may be able to find a stronger pole elsewhere that doesn't require a middle bracket?
* Are there other options I'm not thinking about?

Hired a roofer to replace our roof and build a dormer on one side.  Roofer ditched us and I have hired someone new.  Dealing with winter weather so nothing is getting done quickly. Oh, an no insurance coverage.

At this point leaks are happening on one side of the new dormer.  Contractor is trying to stop the leaks, and is also fighting the weather to just get the job done.  Stopping the leaks is the first obvious step but I am not able to get up there and do that.

At this point water damage is showing as wet brown spots one the drywall in the corner underneath the side dormer that is leaking.  Started with wet brown spots on our second story ceiling and walls.  Now a wet spot has developed on the first story ceiling underneath this.  I know whats happening.  Water has found its way in and it’s trying to get out.  I also think that the water that found its way in may have froze, as the weather has warmed and the new spot developed.

I am thankful that it appears to be happening in only one corner.  I guess that’s good news?  IDK.

What do I do?  Do I rip the affected drywall off and hit the walls and beams with mold killing cleaners, then have everything sheet rocked?
- I see us doing this upstairs and taking a less invasive approach down stairs where it seems to be less affected.

Is there a less invasive way of handling this all.

MOLD IS A BIG CONCERN.  We’re smelling it, and it’s making us cough.

Door hinges, handles, cabinet hardware... the whole magilicutty.  Now that everything is switched over, I'm not quite sure what to do with the old stuff.

One thing I am considering is holding onto the old hardware and swapping things back when it comes time to sell.  Satin brass finishings were actually surprisingly difficult for me to find so it would be nice to skip the search process if and when the time comes to move.  Additionally, I don't really know if door hardware will add substantial value to my home vs. the nickel finishings that were there before.  Is this something that is considered common to do?  

Another thought I had was to try to sell the used hardware, but the old stuff isn't anything all that special (it's all builder's grade stuff) and I can't seem to find a huge market for this kind of thing.  

I'm leaning towards taking all of this stuff to my local recycling center but wanted to see if there were other ideas out there before doing so.  Any and all thoughts appreciated, thanks!",HomeImprovement,1645261912
1981,BudPad,Some advice required regarding our house waste water drainage system,"We live in a rural place where there is no drainage system for our house waste water.

We brought this house an year ago. The house was built by a builder where he built two identical houses side by side (adjoining each other). Both the houses have two pits dug infront of them. The pits are around two feet in diameter and 10 feet in depth. The idea is the waste water from the house will be fed to these pits and the water will be seeped into the ground. If in case the pit gets full (the builder assured the it might every 6 months) the water should be sucked out by septic tank cleaner.

Now the issue is our tank got full in 3 months after we moved in and we got the water sucked out of it and after that it started to get full every week or sometimes in 3 or 4 days. While the pit from other house never got full in this one year. We checked if the water from the other house is also getting fed into our pit but that's not the case. Both these pits are 10 feet apart. Is there a chance of the water from the other pit is getting seeped into ours.

Is there any better way or design to resolve our problem, will be thankful if any experts suggests. Thanks in advance.",HomeImprovement,1645259743

1983,Trippinthroughtime,Primer/paint still smelling 2 months later? Help!,"Hello! I’m at my wit’s end and would love any advice you can give me! I’ve researched this endlessly and I don’t know what to do. 

I live in the Seattle area and we recently had a contractor out to build an entirely new room - there was unused landing space in the upstairs of our house, so we had the contractor build walls to encapsulate the space and make a bedroom, if that makes sense. So brand new framing, drywall, texture, paint, etc. This space is supposed to be a bedroom for my 9 month old baby. 

However, we have not been able to put him in his room as it smells - to me it’s sort of a musty oil-paint or sweet clay-like smell, my husband says it smells chemical to him. We tried putting the baby in that room about 3 weeks after it was completed and painted, and he quickly developed a hoarse voice/throat irritation/wasn’t sleeping well. Even I get a scratchy throat from being in there too long. So we quickly removed him to a safe room and his raspy voice cleared within a day or two.

Our contractor used Kilz primer (I’ll have to double check which kind exactly) and Sherwin Williams Pro Industrial Waterbased Alkyd Urethane paint. This was painted onto MDF beadboard that we had installed halfway up the wall, all around the room, as well as all the trim and the doors.

Things we have tried:
- leaving windows and doors open for weeks
- running fans, air purifiers with activated charcoal and HEPA filters, and dehumidifiers for weeks
- leaving out bowls of vinegar, lemon water, baking powder
- leaving our activated charcoal bags
- sealing and “baking” the room up to 85 degrees for multiple days
- scrubbing down the beadboard and trim with water and vodka on two separate occasions

The smell has diminished somewhat with all of these efforts, but it’s still there. It isn’t so bad when you leave the door and window open, but seeing as it’s winter and my baby needs to have a closed door so as not to be woken up it’s impossible to have him in there. If you close the window and the door and leave it overnight, in the morning it is very musty and oil-paint smelling. This can’t be a safe environment for a baby and even I wouldn’t want to sleep in there.

Is the next step to try some sort of topcoat or sealer? I’m worried that if for some reason (despite over 9 weeks of time and all my best efforts) that if the primer or paint isn’t fully cured then anything we put on top will just exacerbate or prolong the problem. Please help! We paid a lot of money to have this room built and now we cant even use it.  I’m happy to provide additional info if it would be helpful.

Need suggestions for moving forward.,"My fiancé and I needed to get our bathroom floor redone in our 1890 house due to a water issue and we decided to have a contractor do the work. This is the result that according to our contractor is within an hour or so of being complete except for some final cleanup. We are in the USA and he is charging us $5k total to remove the old floor lay down hardiebacker and install the new tiles.

To us the work looks pretty bad, but I'm hoping that the reddit hive mind can weigh in and help us to understand if we are overreacting since it's our first time hiring a contractor for this type of work.

One extra concern we have with this whole process is the contractor applied the grout and left it on the surface of the tiles overnight and it became very hard so they tried and failed to scrape it up and ended up using a standard dry sander to remove the majority of it. Will this cause damage to the tiles? Some of them look a bit worn in places from the sanding. If it makes a difference the grout was polyblend non-sanded grout and the tiles are [daltile keystone collection](https://www.daltile.com/product/Keystones) with matte finish. This process also generated a massive amount of dust they opened the window, but that was the extent of the ventilation. Does this silica dust from the grout/ceramic tiles pose a health risk at this level?

The mortgage would be around $2,500/month including taxes and home insurance. It will go down by $160 once we get rid of PMI - we are only able to put 10% down.
The units will be rented for $1,500 each which is fair, almost cheap for the area and we would put the extra $500 in a fund so that we have money shall the tenants need repairs at any point. With our savings, we can cover the mortgage + our rent for up to 6 months in case both units sit vacant. The home is located in a great neighborhood and it's 1.1-1.5 miles from three major universities so it shouldn't be too hard to rent.
The reason why we would continue to rent ourselves rather than movin into one of the two units is that right now we have an amazing apartment and our rent is very cheap compared to the average for our area, we also have an extremely helpful landlord, and we don't really want the stress of moving all our stuff, which probably wouldn't fit in one of the 2 units as our apartment is about 300sqft bigger. Since we can't quite afford our ""dream home"" yet, we thought maybe an investment property as our first buy would make more sense - then of course we'd have the option to move in later on shall the landlord raise our rent or sell the house, etc.
We don't really have anybody to ask for advice - we come from working class families who never bought a house (my parents) or only bought the cheap home they currently live in (his parents), so I am asking all of you Reddit strangers: is this a good idea or a terrible one? What are things to consider? If you have done something like this, do you regret it?",realestateinvesting,1645925085

But if i buy a multi first, then i can live a year for free and then move out to a single family a year later while using one mortgage to almost pay for both. With the market right now, i lost two offer on multifamily that were about 500k. And the others houses that are showing up on the market are in terrible location. I just found a single family for 300k that really like, I think it will go up in value the upcoming year. If buy a single family first, is the interest or downpayment that big to buy a multi family later. I do want investment property. But after buying a single family, if the interest rate or downpayment isnt like that huge and costly, then i can buy the single first and buy the multi.

2031,BombayDreamz,How to consider shared hack-house with sister for taxes?,"My sister and I are doing our taxes for the first time, and I'm curious on people's opinions. We bought this house 67% - 33%, with me putting up the whole up front cost and her paying me back over time. She lives in about half the house and the other two bedrooms are rented out to tenants. We agreed on a somewhat below market rent for her portion ($1,200 versus $1,500, say), and she pays that amount to ""us,"" so two thirds of that amount goes to me (since the other portion would just go back to her).

So, for considering what counts as a rental property, clearly the other two bedrooms rented to unrelated tenants can be expensed, depreciated, etc. with me taking 2/3 if the deduction and my sister taking 1/3. But for the bedroom my sister lives in, can *I* take depreciation on my 2/3rds since she is paying me rent, even though she is a co-owner?

My decision was to go ahead with the inspection since I already paid the permit renewal fee and just work on the personal use transition for 2022.  Had the inspection done 3 days ago, my tenant said the guy was there barely 10 minutes, and said everything looks great, no issues at all, and left.  The prior inspection was 16 months ago and passed after installing some deadbolts and adding a couple more smoke detectors.

An hour later I get an email that the inspection failed, instructing me to submit a bunch of maintain use permits for a 2018 boiler (boiler is from 1994 and maintained yearly!), a finished basement, and a basement bathroom.  And that if I don't produce these permits within 30 days I will receive an ""appearance ticket"" which in googling I learned is a criminal court appearance for an arraignment.

This is a single family residence built in 1929, in my family since 1982, with the same tenants since 1984.  My father renovated it at time of purchase and I have stacks and stacks of papers and receipts to the extreme.  There is NO way my father did ANYTHING without following the letter of the law.  I have no idea what the heck all this stuff they want is, and I immediately asked the inspector to call me and he refused, saying he's on the road and only does email.  I called the building department to get some answers but the lady on the phone had no clue and just left them messages.  Next day I emailed the inspector plus the town clerk I've dealt with numerous times expressing my confusion and begging for help or an explanation and got a one sentence reply that they'll forward my email to a supervisor.  I dug up the phone number of the last inspector who passed the prior inspection and haven't heard back from either.

Everything I've read on the website seems to say that I need a crapload of architecture plans and inspections and contractors and plumbers and all these people to sign off on basically everything that's been done to the house in the last 40 years.  My 90 yr old tenant just lost her husband, I cannot charge her more than she can afford, and what kind of evil person would I be to put her on the street???  I live several states away and have no money or mental resources to go through everything they seem to be telling me. And criminal court!?!?  Arrested??

2040,HenryLazerow,Deal Diary: Chicago - Avondale 2 unit BRRR (house hack),"My client was cool enough to let me share their deal to help other new investors. 

What is BRRR: It's a way to grow your portfolio while re-using the same money over and over again. What you do is rehab and then cash out refinance after rehabbing either all or a majority of the funds to help finance your next investment. I sold this client their last deal 7/14/20 and we already less then a year later have another deal under contract, this time a 3 unit nearby.

Deal: Large 2 unit in Avondale. Was very dated inside with wood paneling on the walls and the ugly drop ceiling you see in an old dentist office haha with negotiating we got it for $432,500. 

Rehab: Lots of new drywall and gut rehab the kitchen/bathrooms. Budget: confidential but was low enough that client was able to pull out majority of their money invested on refinance as well as create significant equity. 

Financing: Cash out refinance into a conventional loan. The inital financing was FHA 203K which I usually do not like using as the costs can get crazy but we were able to make it work being a 2 unit and keeping it relatively cosmetic. (not changing layout, hvac system, etc.)

I also did a BRRR on my personal 4 unit house hack and strongly recommend the strategy to all investors.

I found an off market duplex in a LCOL that the owner wants to sell for 40k because he is an older fella wanting to cash out and be done. The property brings in $800/mo ($400 each unit), market is around $600-700/mo for each unit. 

The mortgage will be $400/mo, taxes and insurance are $260/mo. $140/mo cash flow until property is paid off.

I believe I can do less than 10k worth of interior renovations to raise the rent to $600-$700 and raise the property value to $60k+.

If we buy the $1.5M home I calculate we need another $30kish to help cover closing costs and have a little extra $ on the side. Once purchased we would turn around and sell our current home.

2044,MrMaestrodamus,Financial strategies for SFH to duplex swapping? What would you do?,"I have a SFH, bought in metro Boston several years ago for ~600k.  I carry a remaining  225k mortgage (2.9% 15 year, fixed mortgage) and also HELOC 175k (4.0% 20 year, fixed - on loan from family members' home). Some of the HELOC was used for remodelling but some for unrelated items. I should add that my neighbor is a GC and built a 2nd unit on his property and renting out (4k/m).  It's not in my expertise to do the same but I only mention my property is the same size and may be an interest to a developer to do the same. 

My current situation is that I have roomates to help with the mortgage, bringing in $2800 a month, which is something I can continue with. 

Two reasons that I'm thinking to sell is that a recent public transit station completed within 2 blocks of the home. The CMA for 2022 puts my property at 775k. Assuming 10% for costs associated with sales, I would pull back 700k. Secondly, I'd like to take advantage of the current mortgage rates to swap to a duplex and finally have my own residence to live without roomates. 

The big question is the strategy with the lump sum. 

A. Pay off mortgage and HELOC (700k - 400k = 300k) and down-payment all 300k entirely on a duplex and house-hack 1 unit and rent out other. Rental unit likely pull in 2.8k/month. 

B. Pay off mortgage only, not pay HELOC, and put 20% down on a duplex (20% of 900k is 180k). Live in one unit and rent out other unit. Hold remaining $120k as Emergency Fund or  down-payment on an investment duplex down the road. 

C. Not sell SFH at all. 

D. Some other option.

I bought my first rental, a duplex that I lived in at first, about eleven years ago, using a conventional loan. I then bought a HUD foreclosure with cash (it was only $75k with repairs!) to live in. I sold the duplex at some point. I then used a variable-rate line of credit to buy another rental, turn the foreclosure into a rental, and buy a new primary residence. These rentals are doing pretty well, with cash on cash  returns at something like 10 or 11% after costs.  

In December, I refinanced all four properties with conventional loans, amortized over 30 years. I didn't get a great deal on the interest rate: 3.0 for the new primary residence and 4.0 for the rentals. 

In January and the month in progress, I've bought two more SFH that I've hired and supervised people to renovate. I anticipate I will rent these out for a small gain in cash flow, as prices are high. I will want to turn these into conventional loans at some point.

In the meantime, I want to figure out how to get more credit that's not my variable-rate line of credit and is not a conventional loan. 

My line of credit that is secured with stocks. It's about $800k, but since it's on stock margin, I only want to spend about $600k. I like spending this money because I'm a cash buyer, but I wish I had more to spend. To reach the level of cash flow that I want at current margins, I probably need about five more similar SFH to what I have, or else, if I could, I'd love to own a larger multi-unit building that around here would run $2-3M.

I looked at the amount of rent it collects. It will cash flow for me, after taxes and insurance. I researched the neighborhood. It’s a B/C neighborhood. It’s in proximity to hospitals and universities and industry. 

I’m still not any closer to learning why it’s been on the market for 90 days. 

I look at the listing history. It’s already dropped the list price by $10k. Because of how long it’s been sitting, I can probably negotiate down another $10k.

I got a temp ban for posting this on r/homeimprovement (whoops) so I hope this is a more appropriate sub.

We purchased our first home (a 3 unit) in the fall and are working out a renovation plan to make some much needed improvements as the previous owners racked up quite the ledger in deferred maintenance.

Siding, insulation, windows, ceilings, floors, cabinets are all the big to dos but we've also got a wrap around porch in need of a rebuild, drainage issues we plan to fix on top of the desire to fence in the backyard for the pup and install heat pumps to offset the oil-based heating system. Obviously this cant all be done in one fell swoop, but we're planning to have some of this done by professionals (exterior) while doing other work ourselves.

I had trouble trying to find someone in a similar situation and I'm just curious what folks think the best option for financing would be here. It doesn't seem like a HELOC would work as we have little equity at this point. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",realestateinvesting,1645823036
2075,babywrestler,Thoughts on keeping rundown property and transforming into rental property or selling and reinvesting something more turnkey? [CA/Los Angeles],"Hello all!

We've been back and forth for about a year now as what we should do with a property we've inherited. Obviously it's our decision to make based on what we are willing to take on etc., but the advice here is always helpful and is very welcome as our situation is getting to the point where a decision has to be made. 

Long story short: 

-We inherited a house in Los Angeles (North Hollywood) that is more or less very rundown and filled with squatters/addicts. 3 bedroom/2 bath with (illegal) garage ADU. 1,300 sq ft on 7,000 sq ft lot. 

-It has been appraised around $700k. 

-Early estimates from contractors based on photos (without being able to get inspections done yet) have been in the $250k range. I know this can balloon up, so any insight into costs for such a renovation in Los Angeles is helpful.

-Brother is to be paid $250k of inheritance, therefore we are assuming a $500k loan would have to be taken out to pay out brother and to renovate the house. 


The question is whether or not it would be worth taking a loan out for that amount to keep the property and use it as a rental once renovated, or if we should sell it and reinvest elsewhere and have less of a headache.

If we sell the house for $700k, $250k goes to brother, about $50k for closing etc, and we walk away with $400k (assuming the step-up in basis). 

Is it crazy to sell and reinvest in something else right now, or even in the next year or so? Is there something I'm not seeing clearly when considering selling it? We understand how hard it is to get something here in Los Angeles, but assuming we re-invest that $400k and take out a loan for (up to) $500k what is the difference in doing that and taking out $500k to fix up and keep the current property? I feel it is just more work and stress to take on, especially when new to renovating etc.

I hope that all makes sense, I'll edit and respond to any questions or clarify more of our situation if that helps. We have a one year old I am primarily a SAHD with him, which creates a bit of brain fog and should also give some insight to how much we can take on/handle. 


At the moment it feels more sensible to sell and not deal with the extra burden but, again, I would love to see if there's something missing in my thinking and if anyone with a better understanding can give further insight into one vs. the other.

2080,tofumcnuggets,Blowing up the plan and buying top of budget (advice request),"My spouse and I are in full grind mode in a major coastal market where we have no intention of investing in real estate (very expensive and we hate it here). We started late on our personal finance journey but we have made great strides in recent years. Our combined cash and investing rate is 60-70% of our income. We have about $250K invested in strong and steady index funds and ETFs, $10K in crypto, and $120K cash. We will have around $250K in cash by the end of the year. Near perfect credit. We recently started traveling out of state (Midwest and south) to shop for investment properties in smaller markets where we can live and work. We recently came across an off market deal for a single family home on three acres with an ADU already on the property. It is a dream home for us for $500K with room to force more equity, and we would rent or AirBnb the ADU. It’s outside a small but growing market and it seems like it would be both a personal and investing win for us. But, I feel like I’m letting myself and my spouse down because this was NOT the plan. The plan was to buy with less % down a multi family and house hack, or buy a SFH and renovate it then move out and rent it and repeat the cycle. Instead, we’ll be putting 20% down on a $500K property and although we will have a lot of cash leftover to buy another rental, it will set us behind where we would have been. 

How do I square this? The property we are getting is so ideal for us, we can make additional income off the ADU, and we are afraid if we don’t move on something like that now we will not be able to afford something like it for a long time. We even locked in a 4.1% interest rate. We will raise our family in this house. Am I blowing it by breaking the short term pain for long term gain rule?

Owners believe you could add units/structures but haven't looked into that myself at all and don't think they really have either but there's a lot of space in front/back and Bridgton really needs more housing.

Obviously some of those units are way under market. Quick napkin math shows 13% cash on cash return without changing anything (20% down). Bringing all units up to the same (higher) price would be more like 21%.

2105,KeithGPhoto,Insight! Sell home and Make $100k now or Rent it and keep it in the portfolio????,"Hey all!

So currently I'm in a position where I'm building a new home. My thought process with my Current home is to rent it out so I can keep it in my portfolio and basically have someone else pay it off for me. My current neighborhood is one of those neighborhoods that everyone wants to be in and we got lucky and bought it FSBO before the 2020 crazy prices. We've basically gutted it and redid almost everything ourselves, except new water lines.

I want to rent it because then I can either use it for leverage(pull a HELOC, cash-out refi or move back into it because of the low $1,200 mortgage at any point) but the appeal of selling it is nice because I'd have around $100k afterward.

What would you do? If you would sell, what would you do with the $100k, flips? Find a fixer-upper multi-family?

TLDR: Should I rent out my current home to keep it in my portfolio or sell it and make $100k? and why?

I’ve been thinking about taking the equity out of my house to buy a rental but I’m nervous about buying a rental in this time where everyone I talk to is all doom and gloom.

2119,exoticpike,Help me analyze my first deal,"As my post history indicates, I am making my first offer on a property tomorrow. This will be my first ever deal.

IMPORTANT INFO

1.) Price: $69,900. Offering $65,000 due to the property being on the market for a hot minute.

2.) The property is currently rented at $750 with long-term tenants. On a month to month lease, however, I will offer a one-year lease renewal at that current price. Market rent is probably $800-$850, but I'm not going to risk a vacancy over $50-$100 a month right away. I'd rather have solid, long-term tenants up front.

3.) The property has been incredibly well-renovated. Was purchased for $5,000 (foreclosure and really poorly taken care of) four years ago. Everything from flooring, the roof, paint, and just about everything important has been fixed in the past two years. I will rely on a good inspection to help me understand what repairs I'll have to do in the near-term. In the walk-through, only a small crack above the shower stood out as something to keep an eye on. Both me and my realtor are in agreement that the home is in good condition.  
Important note: my city has $20,000 grants that are given to the public for real estate improvements. I'm almost 100% sure the investor that currently owns it did the BRRRR method, received this grant, and wants to liquidate onto bigger and better things.

&amp;#x200B;

4.) I will be investing with a property manager since I am currently on a deployment and cannot facilitate emergency calls. She will take 10% and will remove the tenant placement fees since she is my realtor and will make commission on properties I purchase. On top of my deployment, I have a very, very busy civilian job that allows me to make a very good amount of money.

&amp;#x200B;

5.) Financing: 15% down on 4.75% interest. I will buy my way out of PMI with a $500 cost added onto closing. Truth be told, I am 100% not worried about my interest rate since I intend on doing a cash-out refinance or selling after 10 years and using a 1031 exchange. The flexibility for me with doing a 15% down, allowing me to purchase more properties quicker, is more valuable to me right now.

&amp;#x200B;

6.) I will maintain $10,000 in a savings account for any maintenance for this property and will use the rest of the cash flow to fund other purchases. For each property, I will maintain $10,000 in reserves. In my market, $10,000 can cover virtually everything.

Essentially my mother is looking for commercial property to lease and found a location on her own without her agents help and we went to look at the location with the agent representing the landlord (Saturday Feb 19). It was great and initial discussions went smoothly. The next day when we spoke to the landlords agent on the phone he said that the landlord agreed to a few basic things we requested and we said that we will be sending an offer through our agent which he then exploded and said why we had an agent and that he thought he was going to be our agent (neither us nor him ever uttered any words that would directly or indirectly make him think that) and he told us to never contact him again and only through our agent.

We send the offer through at 3pm on Sunday (feb. 20) and our agent along with the owner of the realty that our agent works for have tried to contact him multiple times and he has yet to respond or give any indication on where the landlord stands and if he has a counter. It is currently Thursday (feb. 24) and our agent has only gotten one text from him on Monday saying ""I got it"" in reference to our offer.

What do we do as we really like this location but we are also looking at a slightly less desirable location which could also slip from our fingers while chasing this one. Were we in the wrong or is he in the wrong? Are there any steps we can take that would bypass him so we can get the deal done as both us and Landlord want it done? The location of the commercial space is in Toronto if that information helps at all.

I purchased my first home in 2017, (salt lake city area). Since then, I've accumulated over double what I paid in equity. I purchased for about 200k, and my condo is now worth 400k. I have a hard time just letting this place go, as I always saw it as a financial investment. However, selling now means my next home is a very large upgrade (actual house vs condo) and a lower payment, plus no landlord shenanigans.

If I rent the place out, I'm looking at about a $550 profit monthly on top of the mortgage being paid (about $1750 total with the mortgage and rent monthly). I'd plan on selling within 3 years to avoid capital gains (if I'm understanding correctly...). Not to mention being THE hottest market in the country with no signs of that slowing down. A huge amount of stores and shops are going in right next to me in a few months as well if that means anything (costco, movie theater, over 30 shops and restaraunts). 


I'm truly lost and so anxious about what to do? Sell and buy a nicer place vs. rent and buy a cheaper place but collect rent and gain more appreciation (potentially) on both places?

My idea would be, that because i would have the majority stake, i would ultimately have say so on most things. I would get the bedroom, he would get the loft. Then we would split utilities and repairs costs 50/50. Basically it would be a buy and hold type of purchase and if sold he gets his 30~% plus any built equity out of the sale. 
Is there a better way to structure this? Should i maybe charge him a small rent until a 50/50 stake is reached? Is the rough idea of the plan that i have so far the best way to keep it?
Obviously, if it was a 50/50 split I wouldn’t question anything because that’s simple. I just keep thinking on it and feeling like he gets the best end of this deal as he is only footing 30% of purchase cost and getting the same luxury i am while i am paying the other 70% of the purchase price.

My partner and I were looking to refinance a couple properties after fixing them up and had our crew run through them. We’re looking at about 200k that we’re going to pull out. Right now we have 4 properties total. Fix and flips are okay in my area of upstate NY as the ceiling for home prices isn’t very high (200k-250k would be high end) with average purchase price of 150k for a decent looking place

We want to go bigger and better but wanted to see thoughts on things we can do within the real estate space. 

-potentially looking to buy larger apartment building (20+ units) and start scaling up 

-we have good relationship with a local bank who will refinance at 100% (ARM after 5 years) for properties owned by certain companies (they own a good amount of units in the city). keep picking up 1 house/multi at a time every few months

-possibly offer those companies to take a large part of their portfolio with a large down payment of that 200k. Either privately through seller financing or going through the bank where we just pay closing. The seller financing part was that they were open to selling a large portion of the portfolio as they were looking at retirement soon

- look into some run down properties and purchase sub 100k and flip (zoning laws are pretty strict for rentals if you’re not grandfathered in

My partner and I are confident that we can tackle any of those options with our team. 

Just looking to see thoughts on the options above I’ve been thinking about and if anybody else would have some input it would be greatly appreciated

I plan on living here for 1 year and then renting out both sides.

Gross rent for both sides = $1,400 per month (accounting for  $50 increase in rent)

10% Vacancy 

=$1260 operating income

Purchase costs @ 4% 
Property taxes ~$1600 per year
Insurance ~$840 per year
Property management @ 10%
Maintenance @10%
Capex @ 5%

=$539 per month operating expense (didn't include utilities because once I move out they will pay for them)

Loan payment = $773 per month

Loan payment + operating expense = $773+$539 = $1,312 = total expenses

Operating income - total expenses = -$52 in cash flow 



-$52×12 = -$624 = yearly cash flow
Total cash invested = $36,000 downpayment + $7200 closing costs = $43,200

-$624/$43200 = Coc return = -1.5%

Taking away the property managemt fee i become cash flow positive, but from what ive read on here is that you should include it in your analysis even if you plan on managing yourself. Taking it away I become cash flow positive $74/month.

I've been looking for a while and am at a point where I need to buy a house sooner or later. I have an adhd german sheperd that I rescued and he needs a back yard.  I was hoping to make this house a good investment, but duplexs are extremely rare in this area and this is one of the best deals I've been able to find from a year or so of diligently looking. All other duplexes that I've seen around the major city area (that I can afford) are going for $250k+. From listening to bigger pockets podcasts every day I've gathered that I need to just jump in with the best numbers that I can, regardless of if I'm barely cash flowing. I believe that in general houses will continue to appreciate and although cash-flow wise, the deal doesn't make sense, I feel as if the growth of the city I'm near will bring everything up.

2189,TruthSeekingIsFun,Risk Averse but Want to Invest in Real Estate,"My husband and I just had our offer accepted on a home last night. It's located in Southern California, less than 10 min to a number of very nice beaches, a great size (2200+ sq ft), single story, paid solar, great schools, etc. However, all morning, my husband has been having major doubt about moving forward. We are definitely buying at what feels like the top of the market, but the market could still go up considerably. Our interest rate is higher now than what we could have gotten a couple of months ago, but at interest paid per sq foot, I don't think we are doing too bad. My husband has been looking at homes for what seems like several months. We backed out once already because of his indecision, and saw the value of that home increase by 200k within a month. It made us sick to see that because of our indecision and lack of confidence in the investment, we lost out.

We own another home that we plan to rent out, very different type of home in a different area of Southern California, and while we love this house and the views/area, we have been talking for years about wanting to get close to the coast and rent out our current home.

How do you deal with indecision/risk aversion and decision paralysis with a real estate market that is so competitive yet seems to be changing this year?

I'm trying to push my husband to stick with this home and move forward (again, we just found out last night that our offer was accepted but I feel that my husband was praying all night that it might not be so he could blame the offer not being accepted for not getting the house.) I have shown him the videos and possibilities of this home and all of the benefits so many times.

They wanted to utilize sweat equity &amp; hope to get it listed while the market remains hot. But they recently received an offer from a property management company.

The company’s offer details that I know about are
1. The company would pay rent to the couple at 25% of current market with yearly reevaluations. The company then would rent out the property for a profit
2. The company would take the property as is &amp; handle repairs out of their share. No repair costs would go to the couple &amp; the house would be ‘market ready’ when the lease is up &amp; not renewed 
3. They want a 10 year lease commitment to cover repair expenses &amp; still turn a profit 
Unfortunately only info I know was brought up in casual conversation &amp; I didn’t want to pry so I don’t know details about handling of property taxes, insurance, utilities or other expenses.
My neighbors have committed to nothing yet &amp; are taking a copy of the contract to a lawyer for legal advice.

I currently own a home that I would like to 1031 exchange out of state. This was my primary residence and became a rental to a single tenant for the past 10 years. Only thing is, is that I never paid income tax on it-- I rented it below market rate to a single tenant, never raising rent. I am aware it's not kosher, however this is the situation I'm in now.

Is it possible I 1031 exchange this or will there be some legal implications to this?  Would initiating a 1031 raise some eyebrows?

2223,DecentCity,Who is responsible?,"I own a 1 bedroom condo in Vancouver, BC in an older building that I rent out to a young couple. Recently they had a leak in their bathroom from the ceiling. Strata called out an emergency plumber who came out and made a hole in the bathroom ceiling to determine the cause. Turns out it's a faulty shut-off valve for the toilet in the  unit upstairs. I've been told The owner of that unit is replacing the shut-off valve but I want to know who is responsible to pay for repairs to my unit for the ceiling?

I think it's the owner of the upstairs unit, is that correct? If that's the case how should I proceed to get it repaired? I don't have his contact info so I'm not sure where to start. I asked the management company and they deferred me to the building manager who hasn't responded. The management company is changing at the end of this month so I don't think they really care and are waiting it out.

Any advice appreciated. Thanks",realestateinvesting,1645578954

The only difference between the two is that the 100% is 1 point higher cost to borrow. 

My plan would be to refinance and pay the HELOC off within a year or so.

Buying details: This property is about as turn-key as it gets. It was listed at $150k, but negotiated down to $125k. I'm putting 20% down and got a mortgage at a rate of 3.25%. The property has one unit already rented, and the other vacant. The rented unit goes for $850 a month, and the other unit is identical so would likely fetch the same, if not more. The mortgage/escrow should cost about $1,000 per month.

*I suppose the purpose of this post was to ask for any advice, or knowledge you wish you knew before you closed on your first property.*

2232,KingSamy1,Intrinsic value of condo,"Hi Guys,

Someone had made an offer on my condo which was not available for sale. It seems a nice offer and I am trying to calculate what the intrinsic value would be.

So here was my formula:

Purchase Price (305K)

\+ Taxes Paid over years (40K)

\+ Upgrades done over years (40K)

\- Rent collected (120K)

= Intrinsic value (265K)

&amp;#x200B;

and once I subtract offer from Intrinsic value that is my profit as such. The offer is for $388K.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I started to think, (and where I need this communities help):

\- where should I add my mortgage payment and HOA, that has be addition to above formula also, right ?

\- What about remaining mortgage (130K) I have to pay with my bank where should that number be used... like how do I know my real profit.

2240,shapattack1,Help Me Figure Out How to Buy This Duplex House Hack Now and Sell My Primary Later!,"TLDR: I want to sell my current primary residence and buy a duplex house hack, but the duplex is on sale now, and I wont be able to sell my current residence for at least 5 months. I can only afford the duplex if I sell my current home. Could I do a cash-out refi to buy the duplex now and then sell my current home in 5 months or will a refi prevent such a fast sale after the refi. Would a HELOC work? Aren't those interest-only loans, which would encumber my home and make is less marketable to sell? Any other creative ideas?

Here's my numbers:

I bought my first house in July of 2020 for $381,000  - a primary residence, single family home. Since then, appreciation has skyrocketed in my area and I could sell today for between $80K to $100k higher than purchase price. My two years is up in July 2022 to avoid any capital gains taxes - so around 5 months away. 

I have to move out of my state for a variety of reasons, somewhat irrelevant to real estate investing. A side-by-side duplex, with a new roof, furnace and some minor cosmetic upgrades is now listed as coming soon in my desired move-to city. It's listed for $435,000. I have some narrow specifics of what I'm looking for, matching properties are extremely rare, and this one fits my extensive criteria. 

A 20% down payment on the $435,000 duplex is going to be $87,000. Closing costs (as a buyer) would be around $6,525. There doesn't seems to be any renovation required. So I'll need around $93,525 to purchase this duplex. I'll conservatively estimate that I could sell my home for $471,000, (which is a $90k appreciation). I think selling costs will be around 8% of the sale price (is that about right?). So selling costs would be around $37,680. My principal pay down over the last year-and-a-half has my unpaid principal at about $350,000. So $471,000 - $350,000 - $37,680 = $83,320 for a down payment on the duplex. I can add the extra $10,205 from my own savings to make up the difference between the 20% down payment and closing costs. So in essence, I could afford selling my current property and buying the duplex, but only if I sell.

As an aside, the duplex is a 5bd 2ba, with one unit being a 2 bd 1 ba, and the other is a 3bd 1 ba. Gross rents for both would be around $3,400. I'd likely live in the 3 bd 1 ba, and I know that I can rent the 2bd 1ba for between $1,600 and $1,700 per month. So with repairs, vacancy, capex, PITI, and utilities, my mortgage would only be around $522 per month as a live in (I'd split the cost of the 3bd 1ba with my wife). If I rented both units, then I would net around $150 per month with property management fees considered (although, I'd manage myself and thus would net around $500 per month). So live in and exit strategies work. 

Now the dilemma:  For this to work, I can't sell my house for another 5 months at least because capital gains would make it more costly and I have some family responsibilities keeping me in the current state for at least another 5 months. But this duplex is going on sale in the next 13 days (it's listed as coming soon). So how can I purchase that property now and then sell my current residence later when convenient? Would a cash-out refinance work? Like if I cashed out around $93,000 of my current $121,000 in equity (difference between my $350,000 unpaid principal and an estimate $471,000 new appraisal value). If I did a cash-out refi and bought the duplex, how would that work if I sold my place for around $471,000 in a few months? Would that prevent me from selling somehow? Would a HELOC work? Aren't those interest-only loans that would encumber the sale of the home (or at least make it less desirable to purchase) in a few months? Are there are other creative options? Would my LTV make this unfeasible for buying a duplex while still owning my primary? Could I could the current rents in the 2b 1ba as part of my income for LTV ratios now?

Also for those who are about to say just wait and another option will present itself - maybe. This duplex is pretty good. I'm also worried about interest rates shooting up in the near future, which would make everything more expensive. War with Russia seems like a possibility as well? The future is very uncertain in my opinion. Makes sense for me to lock in now.

I have an alternative theory that in strong markets a reasonable amount of mortgage rate increases, 2-3% from here, could actually have the opposite affect on existing homes, as listed supply drops from current levels.   My belief is most homeowners either bought or refinanced in the last 2-3 years and locked in 3% or less 30 year fixed rate mortgages.   Most people are not going to want to list and sell their existing home and give up their 3% loan so they can move and buy a new one with a 5% loan. They will stay put and not list their home unless they absolutely must move or they get offered such a high price, they can’t refuse.

I’m hoping someone can explain the nuances to me to ensure I’m not accident my committing fraud here.

I have the option of purchasing a home (a buyout of an inherited property from my grandfather split between my sibling and a cousin, so I’m essentially buying out sister + cousin). When I approached my MLO he told said, “*this is basically a refi so you can do it as Second Home*” and the rate is significantly better. It’s about a $200mo difference on my mortgage.

I understand “second home” means it’s a vacation home, and although he knows my intention for the property is to rent it out, “*I just have to stay two weeks per year* [wink][wink]” to be in compliance. 

Now, that won’t be an issue (this year anyway) because I’ll probably have to go stay there go a few weeks just to fix up and get it ‘rental ready’ anyway, but once I actually have tenants in there, will I be in violation of any law as far as insurance fraud or something?

The property has 2 addresses, one for the lower half which is a business and one for the upper half which is an apartment/living space where my grandma lived for the past 50 years. The upper portion has an entrance in the back of the property (alley behind main street) with a 2 car garage. The business faces the main street and has its own private entrance.

 Upon cleaning out the property, we were informed the law had changed in the previous couple weeks. That they would no longer pick up business garbage. When I found the tax information I saw the entire property is zoned as commercial so that is correct that we wouldn't qualify for garbage pick up. 

Just questioning if this is correct or normal for the entire building to be zoned commercially or if it can/or should be split?

Every building on this street is the same,  business below and apartment/home above. These buildings were built in the 1860s, just for reference. Each building only has 1 apartment above it. 

Garbage had been piling up in the back alley way where the access is to these 8 to 10 apartments. It finally was cleaned up, but it just feels wrong when people actually live in these spaces and now we are being told we need to rent dumpsters to toss our garbage.

We were in the middle of renovating and he needed place to stay and really wanted one of our units.  So we allowed him to move in while we still did the finishing renovations.  I told him it would be a mess and he was very accommodating.  He even helped with some of the work we did on another unit.  

He was a great tenant.  Paid on time, was a great resource for filling the other units as he was always positive and made others feel very comfortable when they met him.  

He signed a 6 month lease, but a great opportunity came up with his job which made him have to abruptly move out about 3 months before his lease was supposed to end.  I told him we were sorry to see him go but completely understood.  I told him we charged $200 flat fee, which was basically for my time to relist the room and get it re-rented it, and then I would prorate the remaining rent back to him based on when the next tenant moved in.  He was very understanding and was good.

During his process of cleaning the unit (which it is absolutely spotless), he was washing the window and it shattered.  He thinks it was an old window but he understood if that needed to come out of his deposit.  I told him I would get a quote from my window guy and get his deposit back to him ASAP.

My partner thinks I am being too harsh by charging him for the broken window.  I think this was fare.  he really was a great tenant, but he also terminated his lease early.  We also accommodated him by allowing him to move in early.  Did we really owe him more because he helped me put some shelving up?  Keep in mind he isnt actually asking for ANY discounts, this is completely coming from my partner.

So I'm in the fortunate position that I'm renting an apartment from my grandfather. I've been living here for about 7 months. The only ""rent"" I'm paying is my electricity bill. My monthly income is about 2200USD. So needless to say, I can save a good chunk from my paycheck every month. My long term goal (two years) has been to save up enough money to buy my own apartment, but it actually looks like I'll be able to do that this coming summer. I would then ofcourse move out of my grandfathers apartment.

So what I'm now considering is just to buy an apartment and rent it out, and continue to rent my grandfathers apartment. I'm thinking about buying a renovation object and do some work here and there troughout the coming years. The apartment would then rise in value, I hope.

Does this sound like a good plan, or am I out of my depths? I don't have any experience with any of this, so I'll be a steep learning curve. But I gotta start somewhere. Would you do something different? Is there anything I'm forgetting? Thanks!",realestateinvesting,1645472605

The lake is 1.0-1.5 hours away from a big metroplex. Southern state with 6-7 months a year of lake weather. Lake is also great for fishing and hunting. 


I'm thinking about tearing down the existing house and building a new house specifically designed for STR / AirBNB'ing. 


I'm thinking 3 evenly sized bedrooms with king beds, each with their own bathroom, shower, and small closet. Then a 'kids room' with 4 bunk beds, with a fourth bathroom separate, but next to that room. A large living room &amp; kitchen/dining area, and a nice outdoor patio space with a grill, seating, dining, TV, etc. I'd also rebuild the covered boat dock. Basically I'd design the house to be what myself and my friends look for when we go on weekends lake trips. 


I'm thinking I could rent it out 3 weekends a month, and then utilize it 1 weekend a month with friends. 


With a brand new build I imagine my maintenance/repair expenses would be fairly low for several years? But I'm also curious to hear what building suggestions you all might have to help the longevity of a STR house?


I currently live with my girlfriend in the metroplex in her house and pay her rent. Her place is near both our workplaces so until we retire in a few years this living situation makes the most sense we think. 


My short term goal would be to have the rental income at least cover the mortgage &amp; all expenses, as well as providing us with a monthly weekend getaway. Once we retire in a 5-7 years I would utilize it much less, and would hope it would then turn a small profit.


With current lumber prices and construction backlogs I imagine this isn't something I'd be able to accomplish soon. I'm just trying to get a solid game plan and start ironing out a to-do list, and perhaps tackle this over the next couple years.

Info:

- Other two units bring in a combined $3425/mo.  This is somewhat under market value, but the tenants have lived there for 5+ years and have never missed a single month of rent.  I have lived on the property for over a year and I enjoy sharing the property with them (quiet, respectful, etc.).

- Property is in a good neighborhood in a very desirable part of town.   

- with 20% down PITI will be roughly 6k/mo.  Plus roughly $600/mo for utilities.  So after rent, looking at about $3200/mo for me.

We have enough to probably put 35% down on a house without selling the condo. 

However if we go that route, our savings acct would tapped and our mortgage payment would be double what were paying now, so thinking that putting something like 20% down is smarter? 
If we keep the condo and rent it out we could probably make enough off rent to cover the condo mortgage and one third of the new house mortgage. With our jobs we could pay the house mortgage but we wouldnt be saving much if anything. Our new savings acct would essentially be the equity we gain or lose in the condo and house.

My struggle is, should we sell the condo and put 70% down on a new house and have a minimal mortgage OR sell the condo, still put just 20% down on a house and keep the rest in our savings acct for future investments/kids school etc etc?

Its hard because the condo is in an area that will only increase in value long term but our worry is what if we need the money in the next 5-10 years and the market finally corrects and we missed out on selling right now.

2322,WaltPatrickKristaps,Questions to ask potential property management companies?,"I recently moved out of a unit in a 2-family house I had been owner-occupying (other unit has been rented by tenants since I purchased the house). Initially thought I could try to self-manage because my new residence is only 1-2 miles away, but I greatly overestimated my willingness to do anything management-related. Thus I'm now considering various PM companies in the area (Jersey City NJ) to reach out to to see which would be the best fit.

There are 6 or 7 PM I have in mind, all have websites with a contact form and/or phone number to call. Just wondering, are there any standard type of questions, or even ""trick"" questions, I should be asking the folks I speak with from these companies, to decide which one is the most reliable, efficient, etc? Combined rent from both units in this house will be roughly $3,400/month, so that's \~41k/year.

Three main topics I'd ask about currently are 1) how they handle emergency situations like no heating or if the power goes out, 2) how they decide on what monthly rent amount to list a unit for, and 3) what their level of familiarity is with the neighborhood this home is in (some cover multiple counties in northern NJ).

Although the main thing that irritates me is not knowing how to effectively compare one PM company against another. I don't want to fall into a trap of seeing that one has been in business for 75 years and thus **must** be better than this newer group which has only been around for 20 years. [This Roofstock blog post](https://learn.roofstock.com/blog/how-to-choose-property-manager) is pretty helpful and makes it clear I should ask for current client and tenant references.

2326,Threevestimesacharm,What’s fair here? (dividing up property with partner),"I would’ve appreciate a little bit of feedback on that. I’m very close to the situation and having a hard time thinking clearly.

About a year ago I had a friend who was looking for some acreage that they could build a house on and parcel out other lots. Some property next to my farm became available and I wanted it but it came as a much bigger section than I could afford. So I approached my friend about partnering with us. To make a very long story short they fell in love with the parcel next to mine. They were talking about building there so we sold the remaining parcel that I was not interested in to a third-party, and divided the smaller parcel next to me but had not split it yet or done the transfer. Well now they are no longer talking about building, they want to use this Land for recreation and investment, which to me that it will eventually be sold to somebody else. Obviously I’m pretty upset about this. I was OK with the idea of living next to a friend and giving up some of the land I wanted for my friend to have a home on but not OK with them taking it and selling it to somebody else.

So now I would like to buy them out but the relationship has cooled quite a bit and they want much more money than initially paid for this. It was me that approached them with this topic originally and I feel like I shouldn’t have to sacrifice just to appease them when it’s them that has changed their mind multiple times. Also even though the property is worth more than we paid I am struggling with the idea that I would have to pay them this appreciated amount just because we were trying to work a deal that satisfied all of us in this time. There were considerable profits on the parcel we sold so it’s a pretty good win for all. But also I can see the point that they are half owners of the part that I’m trying to buy them from.

2327,Different_Echidna_12,REIT income to cover rent,"I currently live in an area that I’m not excited about from a growth perspective and I don’t want the complications of a mortgage (at least not yet). I don’t see purchasing a home as a worthwhile investment because I’ll likely move in three years as well. I need somewhere to live but paying rent with no return is eating at me. 

I am considering investing in a diversified portfolio of REITs (with the potential down payment capital) to compensate for some of the rent I’ll be paying. I say REITs specifically because I want to capture the upside of specific RE markets and need to fight of inflation. I see this being a challenging year for equities. 

Am I overthinking this? 
Should just buy a place even though 3 years likely isnt enough time to overcome fee costs? I could rent it out if I leave but this just seems like a headache. 

For the record the area is the New Jersey border of NYC. I see other areas with much stronger growth potential (mainly subberbs of cheaper, warmer cities). Thank you!",realestateinvesting,1645448008

It seems to me we will see a lot more efforts for rent control especially in urban areas and blue states. And it is true that there's a lot less rentals on the market and all with higher rents, which allows landlords to push their rents up to match their competition. But after two hard years and the threat of rent control what else would you expect landlords to do? Lower rents. It's been a hard two years on landlords but nobody talks about that. Tenants who squatted not paying rent due to the moratorium and the increased costs for LLs on just about everything and especially roofs, appliances and rehabs.

I’m in the process of listing it/touring for rent but so far no one has signed a new lease.

**I am considering selling it off-market** (why not on market? bc I think I may be able to net out more without paying \~6% RE commission, and I don't want to vacate it,  stage it, etc. and therefore halt the process to get a tenant). Accepting an offer would depend on what offer price I could get (I would reject any offer at X price or lower, since I am fine to keep renting it out). If I do rent it out in the meantime, the lease has an assignment clause, so the new owner would takeover the lease, which would be a 12 month lease that does *not* automatically convert to month to month.

**Is there any downside to posting this in a FB REI group that is specific to my area/city?** E.g. if I post it, but choose not to sell it, keep renting it, and then sell it on or off market a year or two later, do you think tipping my hand right now would have any impact?

That being said, here this situation out and tell me what to think. HYPOTHETICALLY 
If I find a $100k house, buy it cash and rent it out for $1500/ month I will be netting most of that because I don’t have a monthly note. So let’s say I net $1000/ a month for this property. 
At $1000/ month it would take roughly 8 years to break even on paper (not counting taxes and replacing broken stuff and all of that).  That’s IF the property value stays at 100k. 
BUT 
Let’s say the property goes down to 80k value, wouldn’t after 8.3 years, you technically have $20k in profit?

2372,coldair16,$1M in equity in 2 years. To sell or rent?,"Hey, everyone. First time posting, long time lurker. Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts. My apologies for the lengthly post.

My wife and I bought our home in April 2020. I was at lunch with a friend, who is a realtor, and my email notified me of a new listing.  I immediately knew it was the house for us. We put in an offer for $680k ($10k over asking) and sent a letter to the owners explaining how much we love the house and would be thrilled to one day live there. They accepted and it was ours. This was a huge gamble on our part as it was peak Covid hysteria and no one knew what was going to happen with the economy.

I love this house though I wish it were a little larger (3,100 sqft) and on a larger lot (1/3rd acre).

Over the last 18 months the values in this area have skyrocketed. Yes, like most of the country. Our neighbors house just sold for $1.5m (in 5 days on the market) and it’s smaller/not renovated. My realtor-friend is confident he can get us $1.7m--$1.8m leaving us with about $1m in profit in less than 2 years. Homes here are also long-term renting for \~ $9k per month. (Quick note, I owe $490k on the house).

I know the big question is, 'but where would you go?'

A few months ago I found a 1/2 acre lot for sale about 10 minutes away and decided to put in a lowball offer. I ended up securing the lot for $360k in an community where homes sell for about $2.5m. Since I’ve purchased this lot, one across the street has sold for $545k. So I have some equity there, though I’m not enticed by that at the moment.

We can build a 5k sqft house on this lot for about $1m, leaving us all in at $1.5m or so. And this home would be worth about $2.5m.

Enough backstory… onto the question.

Would you sell the current home or keep it and rent it out:

* A) Sell the current home for $1.7M and pocket $1M in profit in 2 years. Roll some proceeds into building a new home valued at $2.5M. Obviously i don’t need to use all the cash as I don’t mind carrying a mortgage (800k or so). This would leave us with an $800k mortgage on a $2.5m-$2.8m home.
* B) Keep both. Take out a loan to fund construction, which will probably have an astronomical rate of 6-8%, and then roll that into a mortgage upon completion of the build. This would leave me with a rental that costs about $45,000 per year to own (including everything) and income of $108,000, for an annual profit of $63,000. This would be more of a cash strapped position but doable.

I know it may seem obvious to go with B and keep the income generating property, but I was thrown off buy a few real estate investor friends that said the opposite, ""At your age (36) and $1M in 2 years... take the money.""

What do you guys think? Sell and cash out or play a bit of financial Tetris to keep both and rent.

2382,JohnHenry-6280,How do I calculate total return on sale of rental property?,"tl;dr: When selling a rental property, what what is the best way to calculate total annualized return on investment?

I fell into real estate investing and would very much like to fall out again. Even though all the online calculators say I have good cash flow and low operating expenses\*, I've just grown to hate being a landlord, so I'm about to sell a duplex that I've had for six years. It looks to me like I can sell my house to my long-term tenant for a bit under market value, which would make me happy, and still feel like I've had a really good return on investment, which would also make me happy, but I am not confident that I'm accounting for everything.

If you’re itching to say, ""consult a CPA,"" kindly refrain. If I could afford a CPA I wouldn't be asking for help from strangers on the internet. Hey, maybe after I sell the house I can afford a CPA who’ll tell me I was a fool to sell the house!

* Purchase price: 14k including closing costs
* Rehab costs: 92k
* Total cash invested: 106k
* Gross rents: 20k/yr
* Holding costs: 7k/yr
* Net rent proceeds: 13k/yr x 6 yrs= 78k
* Sale price: 225k
* Selling costs: 15k
* Net sales proceeds: 210k
* Depreciation taken: 22k
* Capital gains tax: estimated at 37k including state and federal

\*My operating expenses have been low thus far, but that’s because I’ve self-insured, self-managed, and haven’t had to make major repairs yet. But even though my operating expenses are low as a percentage, they still feel high to me because my income is low.  TBH, I just feel like I've been ridiculously lucky and that can't last forever, or even one more hurricane season.

When trying to calculate annualized rate of return, I'm unsure which numbers to include for both the cost and the gain. It seems important to account for depreciation recapture and that hefty tax bill when evaluating the return, but I don't know whether to use the adjusted cost basis or the actual cash outlay as the denominator.",realestateinvesting,1645375158

2384,MinimumFuel,Which route would you choose for financing next home?,"I will be relocating in about 1.5 years. My current and only home is in Southern California with a VA loan at 2.6%. Purchase price 540k and I could sell it for at least 650k today. Comps have been popping up over 700k the last couple weeks. In a year and a half.. who knows.

My original plan was to buy a multifamily after I move (700k-1mil) and house hack while renting out house #1. I was going to refi house #1 to a conventional, use my one time ""reset"" and use my VA loan again, and put 0 down on the multifamily. I'll have enough cash to handle both rentals, but not enough for a large downpayment and reserves for both rentals.

With rates going up, refinancing house #1 will likely be a much higher rate and effect ability to cash flow. I could also just sell house #1, use the VA loan again without burning the one time ""reset"", and have plenty of cash on hand. HELOC and other financing is an option for house #2, but I'm less familiar with those.

Overall I would like to keep house #1, but the numbers just might not work. I need to talk to a lender and see the details for a true comparison, but what strategy seems best? Goal is to one day have enough rentals to retire early.

2393,pdad1010,How to Scale from Here? - First Property 98% Financing,"I am closing on my first investment (LT Rental) property (3/2, 1200 sq ft, FL) at the end of the month. There are tenants already in place (been in the house for 6 yrs) and I have a signed lease from them. They paid the old landlord $1,495 per month, and will be paying me $1,725 per month. I did consider putting a little bit of $ into the interior and putting on the market for $2,000, but I felt more comfortable easing into the process first and keeping the tenants in place. The purchase price of the house was $265K, so not a great return currently for me, I know, however compared to the other houses I was looking at in this price range, this one stood in a class of its own. It appraised for $275K, and based on comps, by putting 10-12K into the interior, I was advised it could sell for $310K, give or take.

I financed this house through a 30 yr mortgage with most of my down payment coming from a HELOC (7yr/7yr) on my primary residence, so essentially ~98% financing). Not ideal from a cash flow perspective as I am pretty much breaking even (when paying both mortgage, lawn, HELOC interest only payment ($175) + an aggressive principle payment against the HELOC ($325) – not taking into account repairs/CapEx/vacancy), but the thought process was to pay the HELOC portion off out of my “own money” – my income from my small biz (main source of income), and keep the net amount, about $435 per month in the new checking acct I have for this property, to be used for repairs/CapEx/vacancy, etc. So, it would still be as if I am paying the down payment portion with my “own money”, I am just getting into the game faster.

My question is regarding scaling and adding more properties. I’m not very comfortable repeating this process for another house, because the HELOC payment that I was paying out of my “own money” from the first house eats away most of my budget for that sort of cash outlay every month. Of course, I could let the “rent money” pay the HELOC payment, but then I wouldn’t be setting aside anything for repairs/CapEx/vacancy. So as to not continue along on the 100% financing route, I was thinking about doing a flip in order to generate a lump sum of cash that I could 1031 into the next rental property. I have not done a flip before – only have basic knowledge of the process – but I have friends in the area who have experience doing this, and a solid rolodex of contractors that do good work for the money, and that I trust. My HELOC is for $190K, of which I used about $69K for the house I am about to close on.

The other thing I was wondering was do I truly need to be that aggressive with paying off the HELOC? If the interest only payment for the first 7 years is $175, do I really need to be putting $500 towards the HELOC every month? Or should I just do the minimum payment of $175, save the $325 towards repairs/CapEx/ a down payment towards the next property, with the idea of refinancing the whole amount owed into a 30 year mortgage before my 7 year draw period is is up and my repayment period begins.

I realize that a more conservative route would be to wait until my job generates enough savings to allow for a down payment from my own money, but I quit my W2 job in 2020 and went FT with my small biz, and while the small biz is steadily growing, it’s not at a point yet, and probably won’t be for another year or two, where I will be able to pay all bills, take care of the family, and have a good chunk left over for investment purposes. Right now, I put about $500 per month auto drafted into an assortment of ETFs in a money market account.

* 2nd floor = $825 tenant has been missing partial rent and applied to rent forgiveness so I can’t ask to leave for another 6 months. $2,000 behind

SO… Covid pretty much wiped me out. Lost my job mid basement remodel and chewed through savings and my meager 401k over 8 months. Finally got a job in sales making $50k base plus commission. It’s been OK I’m looking at $80k OTE. 

I was just about 90% done with my basement remodel (previous tenants when I purchased trashed it). There was paint and some electro left. Thursday of this week we had a rain storm and simultaneously the ice thawed. The city sewer was at max capacity and my sewer line backed up through the toilet and bathtub. My basement was flooded with piss and shit. Just finished cleaning.

This also meant tho my remodel was trashed. I have to cut about 24” of the bottom drywall and demo all the trim too. All the LVP I put down is now needed to throw out.

Insurance: my agent said he doesn’t understand why I didn’t have a rider for the policy, and apologized that the kid who wrote it for me was new and was fired 3 weeks after I got it. Also my deductible is $6200. 

Disclaimer: I’m extremely overwhelmed right now. Two weeks ago I learned I have to demo the front exterior wall and vapo barrier &amp; insulation. I’m the spring when the ground thaws I have to hire. Masons to come in and repoint the exterior wall. 

I am at a loss. I can’t do another year of weekend warrior renovations. I just did this all. I think I want to just hire it out but I have no money in the bank and $10k in CC debt. My monthly income/ commission goes straight to paying my CC off. 

So r/REI: as a homeowner with 14% equity, will there be a loan product the bank could offer me that I could use just to hire a contractor to finish out the basement again? I estimate with labor its going to be $12000 for flooring, drywall taping and paint.",realestateinvesting,1645314574

The house is “fine” but it’s age is showing through and whilst it has a few problems the area is doing quite well. 

I’m probably going to sell myself in a couple of years as I outgrow my flat, but I’m wondering if it’s worth buying the tenanted property for sale and looking to sell both at the same time when I leave. 

Benefits of London capital exposure for next 2-3 years as people move back to the office etc. but also 2 properties combined which might be seen as easier maintenance to the future buyer and achieve a bit of yield compression on the investor demand. 

Risks are that the age of the property develops a material problem that needs to be fixed. Or the social housing below is a bigger downside than I’ve given credit to (current tenants are fine) or just the fact that it isn’t a full multi-occupancy property being 2/3 flats.

My brother is trying to buy his first property, but he was just told he lost his 25K deposit. His bank said the building is “blacklisted” for maintenance fees being too high. 

He had a real estate agent and lawyer working for him throughout the process. 

Another thing to note, he was the second person to put an offer, apparently the first people who put an offer were also declined from the bank for the same reason(maintenance fees being too high). 

I’m not an expert in real estate, but it sounds to me like someone is pulling a scam of some sort, not sure if it’s my brothers agent/lawyer or the condo owner representatives, but it doesn’t seem right that this could happen twice in a row. 

I’m told the owner gets to keep the deposits. So, that means the condo owner just generated about 50K in capital?

Imo, my brothers lawyer/agent should’ve been the the ones to figure out this information, and have a better plan than just telling him he lost his downpayment.

What do you guys think about this large glass block wall? It's kind of tacky, but also incredibly unique especially how it wraps around the corner and lets a ton of light in. Not sure how to feel about it.

If I took it out and drywalled it in, I would definitely get a big window there, but the pain would be matching the exterior siding. Another idea would be to turn it into a brick wall so you would have exposed brick on both the interior and exterior which may be cool? Or do you think I should just keep it in and update the trim and paint around the glass block and door?

2481,ash-male,"25M looking to house hack in Montreal, QC","So, I have this major concern that I will never own property for as long as I live. For the most part, it's my only fear in life right now. 

I just graduated from university and have been doing a lot of research in the field of investing, and am punching myself in gut for not getting into this years ago when I first started earning income; that's several years worth of capital gains/dividends that I missed out on.

To add insult to injury, I've dedicated the bulk of my last three years to having my head in the textbooks and paid little to no attention to the outside world and how it functions outside of my field of study (chemistry). Now I've graduated and am starting out with a salary of as little as $38k CAD (\~$28k after taxes) for a company that is not particularly known for giving regular or reasonable raises. I love the field and probably will continue to work in it for a very long time, but the lack of decent-paying jobs (apparently a common theme in science, where we're stupid enough to accept lower salaries to pursue something we love) is making me want to consider my options, which currently look something like this:

1. Accumulate experience and leave for another company that's willing to pay enough so that I have a roof over my head and won't starve. 
2. Pursue a completely different career path, which is not tempting in the slightest because that would \*probably\* involve going back to school and dedicating another 3-4 years to a new field that may or may not provide me with better career opportunities.
3. Begin investing in real estate and have my rental units compensate for my pitiful salary.

I currently live with family and am spending the absolute minimum I need to get by, and investing the difference into the stock market in stocks/ETFs, and would like to max out my TFSA/RRSP within the next couple of years. However, my a concern of mine is that their performance is quite volatile from year-to-year, and I'd like to own (or at least be well on my way toward owning) my own home 10 years from now. But in the current housing market, it just seems as though I'll never be able to come up with even a down payment (20%) for one. 

I've always been quite financially responsible and don't really spend on luxuries that frequently (if at all). I don't know my credit score but considering I've always paid off my credit cards on time it can't be that bad. 

This is probably going to be a question with a lot of layers to unpack, but given my situation (minimum expenses, pitiful salary, age if that plays a factor) would it be possible to qualify for a loan which I could use to buy a (ideally multi-family, that way I can live in it simultaneously) property that I could rent out and have it pay for itself over time? My biggest concern right now is the fact that I can't acquire capital at a fast enough rate to secure a down payment anytime in the near future.

I will probably be adding several edits to this post as I may have left out a few important details. 

TL;DR: Graduated from university, want to own property, salary too low (and probably always will be) to ever come up with an appropriate down payment.",realestateinvesting,1645237458

My original plan was to use an FHA to build a 4 Plex, but I've come to learn they will only count pre occupied units into your Income(is this correct?), so building won't be an option with my current income(40k a year).

\- First week of December 2021: Was told closing was expected at the end of February.   
\- Second week of December 2021: Heard rates were going to rise from my real estate agent and their preferred lender. Started to talk to builder about their preferred lender who had 90, 120, and 180 day rate locks.   
\- December 13 2021: Builder and their preferred lender talk about my closing date being end of March - December 14 2021: I put a deposit in for a 120 day rate lock with the paperwork stating the closing date was end of february still based on my last conversation with my builder  
\- December 15th 2021: Find out closing is expected to be end of March and it had been that way for over a week  
\- December 16th 2021: Arguments with builder and lender ensue, they give me an extension to the end of April now for the miscommunication  
\- Beginning of January 2022: Learn it will be mid april  
\- Now: Expecting pre-drywall walk next week which marks 60 days to closing (rate-lock in trouble of expiring if anything goes wrong in that time)  


Options)   
a) take the rate hike if it expires and the home becomes very expensive for me  
b) fight the lender about the discrepancy and try to get them to extend the rate-lock to account for any extra days because of their shifty actions in letting me put a deposit down for a time period that was not factual but had not been disclosed to me  
c) start considering a 5/1 or 7/6 ARM since it is my first home and I want to build equity fast in this and then transfer into a home in the mountains after 5ish years.

(opposite of a 55+ community),"I've been thinking about the solution to many people's complaint that there are no starter homes or affordable homes in their area. Not saying I agree with them, just thinking through a solution and had this idea. What if an active adult 55+ community was reverse engineered for 35 and under first time homebuyers? 

The concept in my head would be buyers at the time of closing must be under 35 and be a first time homebuyer. Owner must occupy the property, but homehacking/subleasing would be permitted. Combine this with an HOA that does the events and style of apartment living to appeal to younger people, you've got a neighborhood that sounds like a lot of fun to live in while allowing more of the population to afford owning a home. 

I know there are probably 100+ laws that prevent this sort of thing from happening, just curious which ones they are. Would age discrimination be a thing, or is there some sort of stipulation 55+ communities use to get around this? Is it currently legal to require a loan be to a first time homebuyer for a certain community? I realize that could open a bad can of worms in other areas. To encourage people moving out and moving on, would it be possible to have a higher HOA rate kick in once the owner turns 40? I have heard that 55+ communities do allow ownership from younger folks, but they end up paying more. 

I realize this is a far too complex task for me to tackle, just interested in having the conversation and seeing if there are other reasons I'm not thinking of why this doesn't exist. If the laws somehow aren't as complicated as I'm assuming, it could be a great development opportunity in the right areas.",realestateinvesting,1645205484
2519,Kenman007,Co-signing A Construction Loan With my Father- How do I Protect Myself Legally?,"I'll try to make this short and quick. I know nothing about real estate and the administrative/legal side of it all.

My dad bought four different 10 acre pieces of land and wants to build houses on each. My dad wants me to cosign because I make great money and he wants to build nice houses, but I live over 1,000 miles away from the proposed projects. 

He has brought forth two main ideas:

1) build the first house, sell it, and use that money to fund the next one, and repeat till they're all done.

2) do the same process as the first concept but keep one or two of them for ourselves, and rent/live in.

He seems to be leaning on the second idea but I don't have any intention of moving to that area anytime soon. And in all honesty, if I do business with family I want it to be short-lived and I want to be cashed out (I.e I want to sell all of them so there are no problems down the road). I want it to be short lived because my brother has a lot of problems and I know for a fact, if my father dies and these houses have my dads name anywhere on it, he will do anything he can to get money from it, and I don't want the drama. 

What do I do to ensure these houses get sold if I co-sign? And, what do I do to ensure I get my % of the money that we agreed upon when they sell? Do I need to write up a contract with my dad and get it notarized (how do I do that when I'm 1,000 miles away)? Does me co-signing the construction loans with the bank spell any of this out? How do I make sure I'm protected and get what I'm owed out of this? I don't want to seem selfish or that I'm scheming, but my dad is not the most forthcoming person. I just want to make sure my wife and I are protected. Thank you for the help!",realestateinvesting,1645204961
2520,Bostonah,To buy a 3 family in 2022 or hold off?,"Been strongly considering buying a 3 family investment property in Manchester NH. The goal would be to live near mortgage free with renting 2 of the 3 units out at 1500ish / month. This will be my first property and I plan to go the route of FHA. 

But as we all know the housing prices are ridiculous. I'm nervous if things will crash after I buy and I would be stuck with a property I overpaid for, and if these events where to unfold I'd assume I wouldn't meet my goal as rents would have to drop? 

A close friend of mine bought his 3 family back in early 2020 and thanks to this he actually turns a small monthly profit. According to my numbers(PMI also included) I should be in the range of profiting maybe a hundredish per month, after paying the mortgage of course depending on what property I end up with. My current rent is 1000 / month so this will free up more money for future investments / emergency fund. 

I fully understand the maintained the building side of things, and the possibility of not collecting rent some months , but my main concern is if the market will crash and leave me high and dry. 

This is frustrating as I want to move to Manchester, as I think the area is up and coming and my friends live there and I also like that city. But there's also hardly ANY properties for sale.

We’d put down the same down payment, and everything would be even.

I mean people buy with their spouses all the time and that’s two people. I know that’s a huge difference lol but assuming we are both mature women who’ve been friends since age 15, what are the real risks here ?

My dream is to take the basement of the second unit which already has 1 bed and a bath and remove the garage door and convert it to to an entrance.  This space would be over 900 sq ft as the current garage space is unfinished space not included in the square footage above. 900 sq ft is well above the average for this area

I am an engineer who works in construction so I know the conversion wouldn’t be an issue and the cash flow from this additional unit would be awesome.

Where it becomes an issue and concern is zoning/ resale of the property. The property a quarter acre is currently zoned in an R-1 residential area and grandfathered in as a multi family. I want to know what my best path forward is. 

A: leave to property alone, don’t lose a garage for an additional unit and go through the headache of rezoning 

B: Attempt to rezone, convert the garage to another living space, remove the staircase and access to the upstairs unit 

C: Go for it- do the conversion but leave access to upstairs unit with deadbolt and rent it out while we live live there just not 100% up to code.

2538,11B4V2B,Cash-out refi 2 properties to buy 2 more for investment properties,"K guys, this will be a long one to provide all the details, but I'm hoping you'll stick with me to provide me advice because I'm new to this, but have some ideas. My thoughts don't neccesarily equate to understanding though. 

I purchased a home in Alabama in 2016 for $145k @ 3.5% interest. I moved out of that house and bought a new one in Tennessee, and used the Alabama property as a rental property. It originally had a mortgage of about $800 (mortgage/insurance/tax) and I rented it out for $1300. 

I refinanced the Alabama rental property in November 2020 when owing $128k, new loan amount became $132k @ 2.25% interest. (This wasn't a cash-out refi). My new mortgage became $600, and still currently rented at $1300. (My current tenants are getting ready to move, and I can get $1450 for rent now. I also contacted a realtor and she says I could list now for $215k and likely not to sell for under $205k). I currently owe $128k on that refinanced mortgage. 

My current TN property, which is my primary residence, was purchased September 2019 for $216k @ 3.35% interest. My mortgage was originally $1250. I refinanced that at the same time as I did my Alabama property (November 2020). I owed 209k at the time of refinance, and new loan came out to be $214k @2.25% interest. New mortgage payment initially dropped to $1100, but raises in insurance brought it back to $1250. Home's current value is an estimated $300k. 

Both were originally purchased and refinanced with VA loan. I had to pay the VA funding fee when I first purchased the AL home, but some legislature was passed for Purple Heart Recipients not having to pay VA funding fees, so the other purchase/both refinances didn't require it. 

Anyways, where I'm going with this is, I plan on staying in my current TN home, but I heavily debated on selling the AL property to net roughly $68k. But as I got to thinking, my mortgage is $600, I can rent it for $1450, it's valued (well estimated listing) at $75k more than I bought it for, and my current property is worth $85k more than I bought it for, so I'm heavily debating on doing a cash out refinance on both of them to purchase 2 more properties to rent out. I'm wondering about any advice or opinions about that decision. 

Some of my concerns are:
1. I really dont know a whole lot about it

2.I'm currently medically retiring now so I wont have that active duty army paycheck any more. Best case scenario would be 100% disability rating which pays $3100/month. This worries me because I'd be balancing multiple mortgages at once

3. Housing markets are at all time highs so would I potentially be buying the peak before the dip? Who knows

4. My interest rates are awesome right now and I dont want them to rise, and then have high rates on the next 2 properties. Both primary and investment property are fixed at 2.25.

5. Is it smart for me to do or should I sit down and be quiet and never mention it again. Lol

And I'm sure I have many more concerns, but those are the main ones. 

If you made it this far, I would love to hear your thoughts. Seriously. I am concerned about loss of income from leaving the army and changing my whole life, but at the same time I am eager to get out there and get after it and become my own self-made man...even if that means profiting off debt, and acquiring more debt to make more profits.",realestateinvesting,1645159780

I'm looking into buying my first rental property and learning about the tax advantages of investing real estate (mind blowing!).   


The rental property ($300k) will barely cash flow after mortgage, tax, insurance, vacancy and capx. Maybe $1-2K a year, which is going to be less than the depreciation amount.  


My first question is, assuming I can get rent up to market and it starts cash flowing like $10k a year (like in year 7), can I take advantage of the depreciation I missed out on in year 1 when I was only pulling in $2K in rent? Basically, if I don't take full advantage of the depreciation, can I bank it and use it in the future to offset my future rent income.

&amp;#x200B;

2567,videojay,How to Setup Bank Account(s)?,"Hello, I'll be investing in my first investment property soon. I'm researching the best way to setup my finances. I haven't seen any of the YouTube gurus talk about this piece of investing. Currently I do a little flipping on eBay. It's such small potatoes that I just keep my ebay profits in my regular/personal savings account and keep track of my savings account totals on a spreadsheet. I'm thinking this approach is a little bare bones now that I'll be dipping my toe in a much bigger investing pond. I'm thinking I'll setup an LLC for the property, then have a business bank account that's just for that LLC. 

My questions:

Is that a logical and intelligent approach?

My FL agent told me that people are moving away from these over priced areas as investors and are 1031ing their money to buy multiple houses here.  So My theory is if you live in an area like CA or NY, I'm pretty sure your prices are getting close to the top of a pyramid and I guess it is possible that the pyramid is just starting here.

More than likely I will use this as my primary residence if it is to my advantage for mortgage loans and taxes or rent all five bedrooms. Will meet with local mortgage broker to vet my options. 

Property is valued at $650k (near 3k sqft) and expected completion this year. Expected to be sold as is - no fridge, no stove, no furniture. Has the basics included. More than likely will obtain appliances secondhand on peer to peer resales (e.g. facebook marketplace, craigslist, etc.)

Property near major city and college town. More than likely tenants will be students who plan to commute the 5-10 mins into the city. Monthly rent expected to be $700-900 for each of the 4 rooms available, $2.8k-3.6k monthly total. 

20% down would be $130k, with an estimated monthly cost of $3.2k. 

My finances include a $50k salary- about $3.4k per month after tax. Downpayment would be covered with savings, leaving behind about $20k-40k in reserve.

2588,Nachie,Client wants proposal for how I could purchase her unique 10 acre property,"(the actual question is a several paragraphs down)

I am a permaculture designer who does land management professionally. I help people design install and maintain food forests, ecological restoration projects, and so forth. I mostly work for city governments, schools, nonprofits and so forth, but have a handful of residential clients.

One such client is in her mid 70s and has a ten acre parcel with a SFH on it that she has been naturalizing since the early 90s. This is a once-in-a-lifetime property given how much work she has put in over the years, an established native meadow that has been extirpated from our region, a creek running through it, mature trees, etc. etc. The house is also on off grid solar. It's a great property and pretty much everything but the house itself is under conservation easement.

Even with the easement, she expects after she is gone that the property will be bulldozed and turned into pasture, since that's mostly what is out there now. Yesterday she asked me to put together a proposal for how I would buy the property from her and continue her work there.

During this conversation she casually threw out the number $3-400k. The local PVA has the property listed at $568k as of 2018 and I am confident it has appreciated some since then as our city is growing rapidly and is projected to continue doing so over the next decade. I know she would be giving me the deal of a lifetime on this.

I have a million ideas for things I could do with the property. Personally I wouldn't live there full time but I would like to get a land manager, maybe some interns and/or WWOOFers, and hold classes and trainings and other events as well as use at least some of the property for a native plant nursery.

Personally however my finances are a little stretched. I bought my first house about a year ago and got into a really good situation, but more or less ""blew my wad"" as far as cash for a down payment on a loan. Rates have also obviously more than doubled since then. I'm asking this community to help me think through all the ways of securing this property. 

Refi my primary residence to get the down payment on this 10 acres? I'm self employed so getting a mortgage is a little tricky and I don't want to leverage myself out of existence. I could also liquidate some investments to do the same but the opportunity cost vs. leaving that money in the market eats away at me a little bit.

I am not a property investor but I do want to do more land management and restoration work on properties that I control and this seems like a golden opportunity to step into that. I just haven't even begun really looking at all the financing options of how one steps into this world. I would also form a new LLC to hold this property and receive income from the plant nursery, agritourism, and whatever else goes in there.",realestateinvesting,1645110220

We purchased a primary single-family residence last year, however it is on mixed use zoning, on a street that is rapidly changing towards mixed use/commercial (think East or West 6th, east cesar chavez in Austin, where houses turn in to bars/office/retail, and new mixed use buildings are being developed on vacant parcels). Our property is a few blocks from some new tech offices, across from a pizza place, butcher, taco shop, etc and has a transit stop across the street and ample parking. It is 3 BR/2 BA, 1,700 SF, 1912, 12 foot ceilings, original floors. We use a separate attached former service quarters as an Airbnb. 

I had an interesting chat with a commercial realtor where he brought up leasing our place out as office since it would cash flow really well (I’m in San Antonio, TX, it’s hard to cash flow enough for a residential tenant), is set up well for a creative office/law firm type use, is nearby similar uses and employee amenities, and office tenant build out would be simple. In the meantime, we could purchase another home as our primary and let the tenants pay for the asset/cash flow to us. We don't really mind moving within the city, especially with the rent numbers he was throwing around. I work with real estate professionals a lot so I do know this is sales. As we investigate, a few questions I am having:

I want to understand what rents could be, where are my best places for comps?

Would this be an issue with our lender, since we got a 3% down mortgage? We closed 4/2021, this wouldn’t happen for another year or so.

Has anyone been a commercial landlord? What do I need to consider? I assume a management company is a must….

She has no close relatives and has specified in her will that her property (a mobile home valued at $476,000 in California) will be inherited by an estranged niece who has not spoken with her in decades.

My family has wondered whether we could offer my landlord a sum for a share of ownership to this property so that I could continue living here even if she passed away.  My family's proposed offer is pretty small compared to the property's worth.  Even in the remote possibility that the owner agrees, I suspect the niece could challenge my small percent ownership in court and prevail so that she could sell the home and collect the proceeds.

The mobile home community has a rule that all homes in the community must be owner-occupied, and that non-owners must move out within five days of the death of the owner.  

Two California real estate attorneys suggested a second opportunity:  paying my landlord a lump sum to be declared ""life tenant,"" which in California qualifies the life tenant as the owner of the property until the person's death, when the property will then be passed to the will's designated inheritor. 

For some reason, my family wants to press for buying into the property with a meager sum rather than having attorneys establish me as the life tenant in exchange for a fixed agreed-upon sum.  (Of course I understand the niece could attempt to sue to have this nullified too).

Does anyone have any suggestions either way?  Right now I am living in limbo, having signed a contract with the mobile community's management acknowledging that in the event of my landlord's death, I have five days to completely evacuate the property or face court eviction.  I've had lawyers tell me they have the right to demand this, even though our state allows 30-60 days notice to evict for all other renters not in this type of community.

Recently commented on a post and I want professional insight into this.

My belief is that property growth decade over decade is due to the fact that previously real estate was a phenomenal investment and rents could be increased as the government lowered interest rates and the spread between rent and mortgage payments narrowed but was still profitable.

In situations where mortgage payments exceed rent by a decent amount and rates are on the floor, how can properties increase at the same clip?

Rates can’t be made better. Will they make 40, 50 year mortgage amortization periods to spread payments out making them more affordable?

What are the options moving forward? Actually curious. Also, I don’t want to hear they will go up as they always have - that’s bubble talk.",realestateinvesting,1645053666

A part of me wants to buy a house and here's my rationale: Credit is still easy to get and rates are low. If I buy I'd be underwriting no price appreciation, and see it more as not burning cash each month on an apartment rent. Also looking at it from cash flow perspective if I rented it out in the future, given rents go up a bit. Not planning to stay in LV for more than 3-4 years so will move out eventually.

The house it’s self is a old school vintage house built in 1968 with a old school septic tank *this is our biggest issue*

We put in $75,000 more into the house redoing a lot of things from a 3ton AC , to landscape , to having a professional art designer create a incredible 70s retro theme interior. 

My partner and I both are in the film industry and created this house for photoshoots. The first year we had it listed on gigster we did 80+ shoots making around 60k the first year. Unfortunately we got booted off the website because we had the location listed in LA and that’s not where the property is. (No one searches Joshua tree for film shoots) 


We also had it on Airbnb but since the house is so vintage we’ve had a lot of issues with guest complaining which has been a total headache.

The house since the pandemic started has since doubled in value and is now worth around 300k in this market without the $75,000 additional upgrades.

Realistically I’d like to think we can get 450,000 or $500,000 for this house.

My question to you guys is , I want to either A. Move the business to Atlanta or B. Get into real estate foreals like owning a multi unit apartments in the mid west.

Right now the house is sitting pretty much doing nothing. The low payment doesn’t bother me as I don’t mind it gaining value without any issues.

2630,YamatoSoup,Am I liable for tenants damaged furniture?,"So my ex tenant is asking for a nearly 5 figure sum of cash to replace their moldy furniture. Here’s the timeline of events.
Tenant moved in about a year ago and bought new bed and curtains.
Around late December during rain event tenant noticed a high amount of condensation on walls and windows of master bedroom.
A handyman was sent in a couple days later to find a leak, or source of moisture, nothing found, but crawlspace under house was damp.
Shortly after, tenant noticed bath faucet leaking, and a plumber was sent out at soonest availability to fix. Bath faucet had been leaking through wall and into crawlspace. The leak was minor and the plumber didn’t believe it was enough water to cause the issue. By early jan, the tenant noticed mold growing on baseboards and bottom of mattress.
A mold and water damage company was sent out the following day to assess and found the mold was just surface mold and could be easily wiped up. But the damp conditions persisted.
A plumber was sent out again to look for sources of water and couldn’t find anything.
Around this time, I offered to give the tenant her final 30 days at no cost so they could leave before I continue searching for the issue.
The tenant remained in the house for another 25 days while more furniture and linens became damaged.
Tenant is now asking for a large sum of compensation including moving expenses. The renters insurance won’t cover damages without a direct cause 
I feel that I tried to solve the issue in a timely manner and am not directly responsible. The tenant also did not notice the increasing mold until it was too late and nothing could be done. The main cause is still uncertain and I’m hiring professionals to clean up the landscaping and roof to rule them out as causes before selling or renting the property again.

Great school, neighborhood houses are very much in demand in the current market- as in house comes and gets sold within a week timeframe.   
We were looking for a bigger house since kids are growing plus I am working full time from home so need more space. Fortunately one of the opendoor house got listed on our street as opendoor exclusive - and we were able to get into contract with them w/o bidding war.  For the record, I have no mortgage on my first home - we paid it off.  Also, we have been looking houses in the neighborhood and making offers but loosing in the bidding wars as I am not willing to pay waaay above asking price.  Opendoor house, we were able to seize under its appraised value.  Not saying, opendoor did not make money on it.   
Now I am nervous and confused about first house - should I rent it or sale it ? Sale has advantage like market price which we are seeing are highest in years and we may never see these prices again.  Also,  it will help reduce the pressure on mortgage of second house plus we can do more ""freely"" renovation there.   
For rent, it is good passive income plus house is on the same street as I live - it would be easy to manage.  Also, given 2000sqft house size and schools, it has good rental prospects and can easily fetch around 2200/month.  However, alternate thinking is to sale the current house ( can fetch upto 600K easily) and buy in one of the more upcoming areas around 400K and put it on rental.  But most likely we will end up hiring property management company do maintenance work.

However, my PM told me that all calls to the tenant to speak to them are automatically going to voicemail. Given that the tenant paid most of the rent, I told them to just monitor it going forward. 

Fast forward to February. The tenant has now made partial payments 4 months in a row (random amounts each time) and my PM continues to be unable to reach them. I was told for this month that the tenant sent a friend into the PMs office to make a payment on their behalf. My PM gave the friend a business card and told them to tell the tenant to call. They have not done that. 

The rent is $830/month. As of now their balance is around $650 but continues to rise every month (and this is with me instructing my PM to waive late fees after the first one we hit them with, in an attempt to help the tenant get caught up on their balance). My PM has also not heard from this tenant since placing. The lease is up in August. 

It’s not like they’re not paying at all, but I feel I’ve given all the grace that I can without being taken advantage of. I’m thinking of telling the PM to give them one more shot for March to either make a full payment and contact us about the balance or else to post the 30 day notice to vacate on their door.

2672,GringoGrande,New Law (California): Emotional Support Dog 30-Day Rule,"Courtesy of petscreening.com

On January 1, 2022, California enacted new legislation (AB-468) that prohibits health care providers from issuing an emotional support dog letter within 30 days of establishing a provider relationship with the patient.

There have been some social media forum posts about this new law stating that ESA letters used in a reasonable accommodation request in California must comply with the new “30-day rule” or else the letter is invalid. 

We disagree with this narrative and investigated the law ourselves to get to the facts. 

The legal team at PetScreening met with the California legislator that authored AB-468 to obtain clarity on the newly enacted law. The attached memo summarizes our understanding of the law and contains our recommendations for housing providers when evaluating a request for accommodation. 

**If you are a PetScreening customer no action is required**. We understand the laws - both at the state and federal levels. 

If you do not use our free service and, instead, review your own reasonable accommodation requests we hope the attached memo is useful in clarifying California AB-468 during your internal reviews.

It has built some nice equity and is cashflow positive. After all expenses including mortgage, property manager, reserve account, and other expenses I cashflow \~$800/month.

I'd like to do a cashout refi to access the equity. My property is in a different state and I live in a HCOL area; I would use the cash as a down payment to buy a property here. I have high rent here so it would be nice to have my money going towards my own mortgage. 

Basically I could pull out $200k and I would be cashflow neutral. The increase in my mortgage payment would offset the \~$800 I cashflow right now. 

I understand there are pros and cons but wanted to see if anyone had any insights I may not be considering. I'm leaning towards the cashout refi because interest rates are still relatively low (historically), my high rent would pay down my mortgage if I buy out here, and accessing that amount of cash doesn't happen often

I was told that I can move money to myself from any LLC as an 'owner's draw' and then move it to another property's LLC - but never directly from one property to another.

Also, was told to never use the business account for personal expenses. Instead, transfer the funds to personal account as 'owner's draw' and then use personal account to pay for personal expense.

As the LLC owner, is it against the rules so to speak, to use a personal debit card, check or credit card to pay a company expense? In other words, maybe I have to replace an HVAC system for $8,000, but there is only $3,000 in that account. Would it be okay to write a personal check?

I went on a mortgage pre-approval estimator based off of income and it says we might get a 150k loan, which is not going to be enough for a decent single family in these market prices, let alone a multifamily. We have 30k between the both of us to use as a down payment. Our business plan is as follows (any advice is much appreciated):


1. Find a deal that needs a bit of fixing and is potentially undervalued/not managed properly. Prepare an investment proposal. 

2. Get a loan from family or hard money lender along with our 30k savings to help cover down payment, rehab, and other fees we will need for the deal. 

3. Get approved by the bank (this seems to be the problem...) for a mortgage on the property.

4. BRRR - refinance in 6ish months

5. Try to find another deal for a 12 unit apartment complex using the money from the refinance (and possibly selling the multifamily to have the extra cash for the deal).

6. Repeat with small apartment buildings for the cash flow.

2738,gamblors_neon_claws,What should I do with this half-finished ADU?,"I'm currently living in my house that I plan to turn into a rental unit in the next year or so. The house itself doesn't need much work, but there's one big thing (literally) I keep banging my head against (metaphorically). About 15 years ago, the owners decided to start working on an ADU in the back yard and gave up on it halfway through. The house is on blocks, and it's got the framing, siding and roof done, but nothing else. My lot is zoned for multi-family, so I could theoretically finish it all above board, but I have my doubts on if it'll actually be able to come up to code. If it is possible, I'm guessing what's been done will save me about $20K. So here are the three options I'm thinking of:

\-Spend about $75K on the ADU and renting it out separately (seems like it would be a little awkward for both sets of renters, and there are only two parking spots) or heavily increasing rent on the entire property. I'm guessing the unit could pull in about $850-900 pretty easily.

\-Spend about $10K to finish it out as an office without a bathroom so I don't need to worry about plumbing or code. But is a backyard office really going to increase rent enough to be worth it?

\-Spend a few thousand to make it a workshop and not a dilapidated shanty.

\-Try to get someone to pay me a pittance to bring a crane and take the whole thing off my hands. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'm just trying to figure out what my best ROI is going to be with this thing. I don't have any current plans to sell the house, but if I do, I don't think it'll be for at least another 10 years or so. It's in Austin, for whatever that's worth.",realestateinvesting,1644858285

So I thought of a deal structure and wanted your feedback on whether this makes sense, and also to tweak specific numbers.  I'm going to use imaginary numbers so if %'s seem wild, please suggest more appropriate ones. Here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I put 20% down and get 25 year mortgage for 80%

  \-finding other renters (it would be multifamily, or communal living)  
  \-filing any paperwork with the state  
  \-hiring and managing repair people  
  \-basically everything that needs to be done with the house.  


Year 0-5 - I own 100% of the equity. Partner makes sure PITI is paid, collects rent, etc.  
Year 5 - I own 90% of the equity, partner owns 10%.  
Year 6+ - Partner gains 2% equity each year.  
Year 25 - I own 50% Equity, partner owns 50% equity.  


The first five years ensure they will stick around to see their hard work pay off. If they bail out or skip rent payments before 5 years, they don't get 10%.  If they leave after year 5 I can buy them out for 10%, or we can agree to sell the house and split the proceeds 90/10.

I have been on the sidelines of investing for a long time (read a lot, little action) and I'm looking at this as an opportunity to get into the business. 

My grandmother is not reliant on the funds from the sale so I'm considering how to best leverage this situation (not trying to scam my gma, mind you).

My initial thoughts are that I can do the following:

\-Seller financed with little to no down payment, and little/no interest.

\-FSBO, so lower price for no agents (\~%6).

She will also likely give me an additional advantageous price over retail just by our relationship, but I don't want to run numbers based on that.

She would not be around for the length of a 10+ year loan schedule, so her estate would own the note.  I can't speak to what her will looks like but it would probably pass to my mother. 

Are there any other things that we can take advantage of?

There are a few risks as well.

The house is in a managed community (i.e. HOA) and the rent prices need to make sense.  I don't live in the area so I'll need to factor in management/maintenance/urgent repairs etc.  I don't have anyone in the area but I know some other landlords in the area that I can contact for recs.

2753,boxingfan828,I Need Advice Regarding a Series LLC For Numerous Properties,"I live in Nevada, where a Series LLC is allowed.

Just about every lawyer I've spoken to has advised me to go in this direction regarding asset protection.

I own 10 investment properties - all of them free and clear - so millions in equity.

At the moment I have all of them in my name. And yes I have umbrella coverage in the millions and high primary insurance on each property.

However, my primary residence is also owned free and clear, a seven figure property at that.

I ran into my first legal issue with a tenant a while back - where he made ""mold"" claims after living in a property for only 2 months. My PM did not do any due diligence on the guy to find that he was a career plaintiff - basically filed claims against every place he lived at for the last few years. Let's just say the PM's company terminated her over this mess.

I buy in high end areas to avoid tenant issues and I'm very quick to fix any tenant related concerns, so I wasn't expecting something like this and now I'm very cautious and I won't even approve someone with a co-signer to live in one of my properties.

However, my stomach felt empty and I actually felt sick when my insurance carrier advised me that ""mold"" claims are not covered. This is a major carrier - and I found out the hard way that most carriers out there are not willing to cover mold related claims.

There are no regulations in Nevada regarding mold lawsuits, so someone can go after you without meeting any legal threshold.

He found a decent sized law firm to take his case. 

A friend of mine, who runs his own real estate legal firm, was confident I would win this case. But, he warned me that without insurance paying the bills I could easily spend 25K in just a single year fighting a case like this. It would be hard to get this money back, because the tenant had no assets and could easily file for bankruptcy.

Luckily the tenant was a piece or work and went around his own lawyer to settle directly with me for a few thousand - and signed a binding notarized release of all claims against me and the PM (who gave me half the money to settle). And yes, his advances to settle around his lawyer were in writing by way of email.

I couldn't sleep for weeks when this was playing out - because I realized that all of my assets were up for grabs, since primary was not covering me then neither was the umbrella.

Every lawyer advised me that I need to place my properties in LLCs, to separate my personal assets from the properties. They felt the tenant's lawyer probably looked me up, saw I owned 11 properties and that's what persuaded him to take the case, regardless of how bad it was.

The reason I was told to do a Series LLC, is to keep the liabilities of the properties away from each other - and also for cost, because with a Series LLC I would only pay a single fee per year for the whole series - instead of paying 10 fees per year if I formed individual LLCs (I think in Nevada it's 300-400 fee a year, which adds up quick to a lot more money with 10 of them). I would also need 10 EIMs and 10 bank accounts to keep everything apart, for full asset protection.

Has anyone done a Series LLC? Should this be the move for me, considering my scenario? Are there other asset protection options to consider?",realestateinvesting,1644826971

I (25F) am born and raised in one of the most expensive cities in the country, Los Angeles, CA. I come from a street smart but financially illiterate family and as a unit, we’re all pretty much living paycheck to paycheck with bad credit, no savings and all the other poverty fixings. I’ve got no adults in my immediate life who are financially sound so it’s up to me to educate myself and build the framework of generational wealth for my family.

Here lately, I’ve had two strokes of pretty good luck: 

1. I just got hired at a reputable local real estate company, my first venture into the field with absolutely no experience. I’m very excited to learn the ins n outs of the industry as I’ve always been drawn to real estate, architecture, DIY projects etc. 

2. I’m set to receive a settlement check this month worth around ~75-60k, give or take taxes from a lawsuit I was involved in.

I’ve got some overdue bills to pay off, need to clean up my credit, set up an emergency fund and secure a car (~15-20k). 

I’d also like to take my family on vacation and rent a small apartment to myself but those can both wait as the most important thing to me at this time is securing an investment property (duplex,triplex,ADU) so I can start generating consistent income and create a real estate portfolio.

I know credit is key in just about anything, so I want to start with that. Assuming it takes a while to build up my credit before I can buy property, I want to figure out other ways to invest and grow the money in the meantime (stocks, crypto, bonds,etc)

What are some of the wise ways I can utilize this money to start my real estate journey in an extremely expensive market? 60k liquid is not a lot in LA but I feel it’s enough to get started.

Purchased a cabin on a river by a ski resort my first year after school because I wanted to own something and knew I couldn’t afford to buy in the city I live in M-Thurs. I go to the cabin almost every weekend to swim, ski, etc as it’s only 3 hrs away from the city I live. The property has increased in value (due to pandemic) by nearly 40% and I’ve been overpaying the mortgage since Day 1. So I have a lot of equity now. 

I also have a little rental in another town that generates a couple hundred/month. 

I am considering pulling money out of the cabin to buy EITHER: 
A- primary residence 
B - another investment like my second property to generate income. 

Which is more advisable? 

My 1/2 of Rent in the city my Gf and I live is 1,250. 

If we bought a place, my 1/2 of housing payment would go up to 1500. 
Conversely, if I bought a rental (near my other rental) I could use that extra income to make my own rent burden go down from 1250 to 800 - while still building equity in the rentals and my cabin. 


I don’t make tech or finance money in my day job but I’m not as inadequately paid as a teacher either. I do OK but cost of living is just very high in my city so I could be doing better.",realestateinvesting,1644786310

I'm looking at how to fund the down payment for my first property and could use liquid assets for this. But, I also have the option of doing a cash out refi on my primary home.

I've been living in my place for almost 1 year and the cash out refi would bring me from 3.375% to 3.5% and getting about 50k out in cash which I then would use for down payment on my first investment property.

Questions:  
Is the refi worth it?  
Would you advice to use liquid assets for the down payment instead?  
Is it normal that a refi makes the interest go up instead of down?  
Is 1 year perhaps a bit too early to do a refi?

My worry with the refi is that it'd increase my monthly cost on my primary (slightly) which will eat into the profits from my rental, but perhaps it's worth it to get into the market?

Thank you for any thoughts and advice! :)",realestateinvesting,1644778978

Contractor C: Did a walkthrough 5 days ago, still waiting on quote. He’s pretty reputable, has reviews and an Instagram following. He’s pretty busy and even scheduling the walkthrough had to be a week later than A &amp; B. I told him my budget is $65k, and he said he will quote and we can try to cut down stuff to get it down to that number (which probably means the initial quote will come to above budget).

A little background on my situation: I make 65k/yr. I currently have a mortgage on a single family home I live in. I have very little savings but have good credit and almost no debt. 

My low cost investment idea: there are many empty lots in my city that are going for ~30k. I’m thinking I could purchase an empty lot and have a pole barn constructed on it for around 15-20k. These costs would all be covered by loans. I’m thinking the loan would cost me approx. $500/month. So in my area there is limited shop space available for rent. The idea is to rent the pole barn to a mechanic or woodworker for around $800-$1000 a month generating a few hundred dollars of passive income.

Is this a sound idea? What am I missing?",realestateinvesting,1644772290

 I am in Escrow on a house/guest house combo in downtown Phoenix AZ. The main house is a 2bed/2bath with a basement and the guest house is 2 story, 2bed/1bath. It was completely remodeled in 2019/2020 and is the perfect Air BNB property. 

The problem is - I don’t have an eye for design. My agent recommended an interior designer (wife is his high school buddy) and I had her come out to look at the property for an estimate. She was very nice, professional, and had great input. However - she sent me a quote today for what it will cost for both units and I just about fell out of my chair. From vacant/empty to Air BNB guest ready the front unit would be $30-35k for furniture, her fee $20k, and the back house would be $10-15k for furniture, her fee $10k to design.

Now I understand that there is a lot of logistics to creating a design, picking out furniture, accent pieces, art, linens, etc. But I feel that $70-$80k start to finish is excessive. Maybe I am wrong. Does anyone have any experience having this done? If so, at what cost?

We found pretty much exactly what we were looking for recently, however our private lender had to back out for unrelated reasons. He was going to front a deposit of $250k. 

I'm a veteran and full time graduate student with about $50k net annual income and my friend (not military) grosses about $175k per year income. I qualify for a VA loan, he does not. Neither of us have any debt whatsoever, both 750+ credit scores. The offer we need to beat is $1.1m. He can do all the building improvements through his work as a general contractor and estimates completion of 2 ADUs within 5-7 months including permits, at which point we can reasonably expect to be cash flowing $1.5k monthly with full occupancy.

We are wondering if there's any course of action for us that could salvage our pursuit of this property with our reduced ability to make an up front payment. Between us both we can scrape together $150k. We're still quite new and eager to learn, but the financing industry is something we are slowly figuring out.

Hi everyone!

In 2020 I bought my first rental property and while I’ve learned some hard lessons since then, I also think I’ve put some strong fail-safes in place to protect myself for the future.

In 2020, I got myself a coach who has been pushing me to grow my business and expand. They’ve been a tremendous help, but I’m stuck quite frankly.

I’m looking for some help to figure out why I’ve been unable to attract investors since I started actively looking. What are investors looking for that I’m not offering or showing?

Some background info:

* I have only 1 SFH rental
* I’ve drafted a package to highlight what sets me apart from others, as well as how to get involved
* I’ve built my team and have been active on social media promoting what I’ve been doing, whether it’s renos, deal analysis, walk throughs of properties, etc
* I’ve gone through family and friends with unfortunately no luck
* I’ve highlighted the benefits of working together both financially and otherwise (due to subreddit rules I cannot include in this post)

If you were a potential investor, what would you want to see out of a budding business owner? I could really use some help.

Best approach to “swap” a house with parent?

Didn’t know where else to get initial thoughts on this one so I will start here. Don’t worry - will get professional help, just wanted to take an initial stab here.

One of our family members is looking to downsize as they move to retirement. House is too much for them to handle in old age. My family is getting ready to grow. Our current home is small and only one story - perfect for the family member in question. The idea was to essentially “swap” houses. How should this be done? We know we can gift the houses to each other and apply the life time gift exemption to the remaining balance, but then we also have to deal with the new tax basis. Leaving the house in a trust would allow for us to avoid the “step up” as we would also inherit the original tax basis. That situation would leave us a little vulnerable though if something happened to change the trust and my family could be forced to leave the home (we also plan on doing a significant remodel).

Any ideas? I know this is a kind of unique situation.",realestateinvesting,1644679819
2864,jackandjill222,"Newbie here, I’m in deep trouble. How do I unravel this problem with my PM? If you’re experienced, please I need your help.","Bought a house House was in great condition, placed it with a PM. They blew me off for more than a month. Furnace ran out of oil, pipes froze, and the house flooded. I’m pissed. 

They lie about it and make up some other reason for the flood saying nothing ever froze. I can’t get evidence or clear information so I do my best to handle the situation based on what I have. They say the leak wasn’t serious so I don’t call insurance and pay them to dry it out instead. 

They find a tenant and move them in, but failed to tell me their (the PM’s contractor) left the house a complete mess for the tenant. 

So I hear from the tenant that it was a mess when they moved in. Tenant is pissed. I ask PM to go by and clean up the worst of the mess (leaks, some mold left from leak, etc.) On good faith thinking they’d tidy some simple things (like pot lights that should be popped back in after painting). Instead, they blow off the tenant for a month. Tenant gets pissed and withholds rent. Only then does the PM get there. 

Then I get hosed with repair bills for the PM going in an cleaning up (the mess the PM themselves created!). I see gross exaggerations on time billing, etc. not done in good faith at all. PM tells tenant (without my consent) I’d reimburse tenant for repairs tenant did while waiting on PM.

Now I’m getting better evidence that the leak WAS due to frozen pipes. Now it’s a completely different situation but so much time has passed I don’t think I can call my insurance. Tenant is in a house that could have a serious mold problem come summer (can’t verify how well PM dried it out). House is in my name. Don’t know if this could mean I have to rip out walls later.

This isblowing up into a huge problem and in need this PM gone now. I live nowhere near the house. I can’t go there. 

How would you triage this? What’s your first move? Evict the tenant? Befriend tenant so I can get clear photos and keep him on? Fire PM immediately even if I don’t have a replacement PM? Self-manage for a month or two until I can find a new PM? Who poses the greatest risk to me?

Here are some of my worst fears:

-PM gobbles up all remaining rent and tenant’s security deposit through bogus repair charges 
-tenant finds me exposed with no PM and decides to not pay rent and won’t leave.
-tenant learns my name and has my contact details to sue me.
-tenant stays til summer, his kids get mold poisoning or some kind of health problem, I get personally sued for their health problems. 
-I dont just leave it and I call a remediation company instead. They tell me cleaning up mold will take $60k in renovations (maybe they find a little asbestos sprinkled in since it’s an old house). Laws dictate I either have to disclose this before selling or clean up the mess to make it habitable. Either option saddle me with big repair bills.

Due to inexperience I’ve put myself in a really bad situation. How do I untangle this? I am paralyzed with fear. I don’t know what to do and need your help. Please help me make better chess moves.",realestateinvesting,1644678508

Currently own a SFH that cash flows roughly $250/mo. Upstairs is renting to family on a super sweetheart deal (I know, I know). Downstairs 2 tenants in an accessory apartment. Working through cash out refi, will pull out 20k, remove PMI and cash flow up to $400/mo.

Just moved to Dominican Republic for work (and adventure), but am still looking for the right next move. With the 20k cash out and another 30k in savings, that's enough for a decent down payment, either here or back in the states. 

If 250k is my limit (not looking for PMI again, ever), only options in the market where the existing property is are condos. Not super worried about managing it from afar, since brother who is renting on the sweetheart deal agreed to assist with those things as part of his arrangement. Down here though, that 250k limit could honestly be two places. 

Are condos worth the pain? I keep hearing horror stories and how the conventional wisdom says to wait for multi-unit or SFH at the minimum.

My main concerns - salary took a big hit coming to the DR, and I'm sure I'll run into DTI issues. Could easily buy a unit down here to rent out, then rent one for my personal use (paid for from DR salary).

My bf and I (live together and been together 4 years) are buying an investment property together. We live in Colorado and all houses are overpriced like everywhere else… 
We’re under contract for 550K and it appraised at 620K. He is the one that qualifies for the mortgage so it is in his name.  I just assumed we would split everything 50/50.  His concern is that since he’s the one having to get the loan in his name, he’s taking a level of risk, it also prevents him from being able to purchase a property for his mom which was the original plan until this property was found and it also prevents him from getting approved for a car loan for a vehicle he wants.

1. He suggested that since he’s the one taking the mortgage, we split the current equity in the home, I get 20K out of the appraised value and he gets 50K to make it fair for him. From here, we split everything going forward 50/50, including future appreciation.

2. I told him that’s not fair for me so I suggested 60/40 (him being bigger share holder). So we’ll pay 60/40 from the get go (rehab, mortgage etc).

So 1000-600-(.1x1000)=300, right? But then you need to put a certain percentage aside for Capex, in between renters, etc. How do you decide how much to pay yourself? I know the exact percentage depends on how new the house is and a lot of other factors, but do you just pay the mortgage, have a renter deposit directly do your bank account, then pay the PM, then put x amount into an LLC for future expenses?

Until ~8 months ago we had a good maintenance crew of 3 that was working pretty much full time for us. One person had a heart attack, and one person got into some trouble and doesn't work for us anymore, so I was down to someone that specialized in plumbing and electrical. For over 100 units. Yikes.

The time its taking me to get these properties rent ready again is at an all time high. Are you also seeing things slow down for your turnovers?

Do we get rid of them right away, or wait it out and see if assistance pulls through for them? It has gone either way, and there really is no way to tell.

I've been working with an agent kind of half heartedly. My area has extremely low inventory so we don't speak very often. I would be happiest if I could perform this transaction without having to use an agent and avoid paying the fees because I'm draining most of my capital in closing costs and down payment.

2898,throwaway-keeper,Duplex with furniture included?,"I'm currently looking at a duplex that's taking in above market rent. There are a few reasons for that:

- both units come fully furnished
- utilities are paid by the owner
- current tenants are on a month to month basis but intend to stay for a year or two. 

The cash flow is around 22% right now if I were to self manage. 11% if i paid a property manager. My biggest concern is if/when these tenants move out, it seems unusual to try to rent out a place that's fully furnished. Won't people have their own furniture they want to bring in? Or am I wrong? Also, I'm not sure if coming fully furnished is worth it to enough people to charge above market rent.

2902,Disastrous_Emu_3324,Moving across country - sell investment property?,"I currently own a house in NH that is rented out under a 1 year lease until November. My wife has accepted a job in Florida and we’ll be moving there in July. We’d like to buy a house in Florida once we move there, so we are considering selling the NH house and using the proceeds towards our down payment. I’m new to investment properties so I’m looking for advice on whether it makes sense to sell a rented out house, and what is the best way to do it. 

Some details:
 - we owe around $240,000 on the house. The Zillow estimate is $330,000. 
- the house in rented out for $1800/mo and has been rented out for 2 years (3 including the current 12 month lease). The current tenants are on their second year and have expressed interest in staying on at least 1 more year
- the house is a single family, 3 bed/2 bath house on a 1 acre wooded lot. It’s an older house (1970s). When I purchased the house I put around $70,000 into renovations so it doesn’t need any major work (I used a HUD loan and repaired all issues their inspection found)
- it’s close (7min drive) to a ski mountain, and also walking distance to a town beach on a very nice lake. For this reason I think it has a lot of year round potential as a vacation rental. 

So, I’m considering these options:
- sell to current renter if they are interested in buying. 
- sell to an investor
- keep the house and use a home equity loan to get money for our down payment

Can't sleep, listening for the sound of reindeer hooves and Santa’s sleigh on the roof, your mind is constantly racing thinking of all the stuff you will get?   I felt kind of like that, only in the complete opposite way.  What if this guy was still there and now knew I was coming?

Sunday.  It's show time.  I treat it like any other property.  Wake up in the morning and make my to-do list before I go.  

- Confirm quote appointment with hoarder cleaning service.
- Pack up all the basic tools, toilet paper, water, paper towels, trash bags, and an extra pair of pants and underwear just in case.
- Make sure my Will is up to date

Upon Arrival
- Burst in the door quick to catch anyone off guard.
- If occupied -- Fight to the death and call ambulance if victorious
- Check A/C and Water Heater
- Make sure plumbing is working correctly
- Clean up a space in the kitchen for all my stuff.
- Search for valuables throughout.

I go during the day this time so I have some extra light.  On the drive over I’m listening to a mix of pump up music and motivational movie speeches.  They can take our lives, but they will never take our FREEDOM!!!  Has absolutely nothing to do with my situation but I feel amped up regardless.  Pull up outside the unit and hurry out of my car so my nerves don’t have any time to mess with my head.

Walk up the stairs, eyeing my door as I take the last flight.  It doesn’t look like the door handle has been tampered with.  I only need the key, no drill, so the element of surprise is on my side.  As I go to insert the key, I say under my breath, “It’s go time baby.” Push open the door at lightning speed and hear a loud THUD!......

What was that?  Am I dead? Does the afterlife look exactly like this trashed apartment? Smells the same too, gross.

I don’t see any movement on the inside, no holes in my shirt or blood on my clothes.  I walk down the first hallway really slowly announcing my presence again.  “Hey buddy, it’s me, your friendly friend coming to check in on you”, “I’m just hear to come and talk, it’s okay”.  No response.  On second thought, I don’t know what I expected. Who even says friendly friend?  If I were him, I would know something was up if they spoke like that. 

When I get into the living room, I find a big stack of papers that had fallen over.  Maybe I opened the door so quickly it created an air vacuum and the papers fell?  That would explain the loud thud.  That’s probably it, right? 

I try to put my mind at ease by thinking that it is impossible to run through a room of papers and trash and get in a closet without making a noise, in the time that was available.  There’s no way that someone could be in there.  That doesn’t mean I’m not going check every inch of the place again, though.  Don’t be silly.

With the extra light from the sun, I can more quickly scan the whole apartment.  Everything is how I left it, or at least I think it is because it was a disaster then and nobody showed up to clean the place while I was gone.  Bathroom still a disaster, back room still cluttered, none of the paintings or knick knacks have been moved.  Let’s get this over with.

I go to the second bedroom and go right in, no hesitation.  If this is in fact the afterlife, maybe the other side is full of a big filet mignon buffet.  No buffet, just trash.  Bummer.  Still no person but one last place to check……

I climb the mountains of papers and plastic bags and head right to the closet.  All that motivational stuff has worn off and I’m tired.  Tired of wondering what is behind the door and tired of being afraid.   My nerves are shot, I can’t feel anymore nervousness, fear, excitement.  I slide open the door and breath an enormous sigh of relief.  Just boxes.  I just leave the door open and feel an extreme sense of calmness.  The apartment is empty. All of this for nothing… that’s a heck of a lot better than it being for something… 

As I head out of the apartment to go to my car, there is an elderly gentleman walking up the stairs.  Although the apartment is empty, every time I see somebody my body reacts as though it’s the guy coming back.  Just went out for a long walk and got lost.. He looks at me with a confused face and says “new neighbor?”.  I’ve gotten this a few times because it is a 55+ community and I am not 55+.  Some of the residents literally have nothing else to do with their time but concern themselves with what you are doing.  He tells me all about how he heard that the place was trashed and that the guy who lived there had some health problems.  He thinks the state came and removed him.  As sad as it sounds, I hope that’s the case.  The guy is in a place where he is being taken care of and I don’t have to worry about him showing up again.  You never know with some people.  Maybe he skipped town hoping the foreclosure would blow over and then show back up 9 months later like nothing happened.  Some people honestly believe that they can outwait their bills. 

No time to worry about that.  Now it’s time to get to work.  

I get to my car and grab my stuff.  Get outside the apartment, pull my to-do list out of my pocket and cross off the first two things:

~~- Burst in the door quick to catch anyone off guard.~~
~~- If occupied -- Fight to the death and call ambulance if victorious~~

Feels good to be making progress.

Put on gloves, get the trash bags, and start throwing everything away.  I must have thrown away an entire ER worth of gauze, spray antiseptic, those big square bandages, soaps.  With the kitchen clean, I set all my stuff on the table and get to clearing the rest of my to-do list.  

To no one’s surprise, the AC unit does not work but hopefully I just need to put new batteries in the thermostat. I go in the bathroom and flush the toilet.  Water starts spraying everywhere.  I reach under the toilet to turn the water off at the source but it stops spraying when the tank empties out.  It’s way too much water for paper towels but thankfully I find some towels in the bedroom closet. Apparently the seal between the tank and the bowl is faulty.  I am still new to RE investing and this was a first for me.  Now I know that it’s actually a thing. I go to the second bathroom and flush that one to make sure I at least have one to work with.  Nope, same issue.  It’s a good thing the lady that lived there had 12 towels in her closet.  Never know when you’re going to need them.  

No A/C, No toilets.  Maybe I will need those extra pants after all.

I turn the faucets on in all the bathroom to see if water comes through but I’m too worried about leaks to leave them running and check the hot water.  They work, they didn’t leak everywhere the moment I turned them on, that’s good enough for me.  

Now it’s time for the fun part.  Looking for treasure.  I will post pictures of the highlights.  Still sorting through everything.  I will put the link as an update at the bottom of this post when their ready.

A piece of advice to anyone who encounters this type of situation in the future.  Stuff that you think is cool is not always valuable, and vice versa.  It takes forever to sift through everything if you are pulling up every item on eBay to see if you hit the jackpot.  It’s disheartening and incredibly time consuming to find that a 1960s mint condition original electronic calculator still in the case with manuals, is actually only worth $8.  Focus on the stuff that you know will have value and go from there.  Jewelry, gold, and silver is the best place to start.

I start out in the back bedroom closet to try and find any jewelry or cash.  Find a bunch of old coins, some watches, necklaces, pins.  Gaudy costume jewelry that you envision when you think of your grandma going out with her friends to holiday brunch.   I have no idea how to tell real gold from fake so I just put it all in bags.  Not knowing anything about currency, I do the same thing. I find dollar bills from the 1920s, 30s, and 60s, a 1881 Morgan Silver Dollar, and a bunch of 1964 Kennedy Half Dollars. 1881?  That has to be worth some serious money, right?  

Digging through all of the trash, this condo is a 1940s – 1960s time capsule.  Coins, photo cameras, pair of binocular glasses (sport glasses), statues, 1960s art work, World War 2 military items, occupied Japan porcelain dolls, newspapers, magazines, old vinyl record players, stereo equipment, TVs with VHS players and stacks upon stacks of VHS tapes.  Apparently the guy would print off the Turner Classic Movie schedule and record everything.  I found all of the print outs of the schedule for 2 years! I even found the Clinton Inauguration tapes.  The majority of bags that I go through are just bags full of more bags.  I don’t have all year to do this so after a while I start looking for anything that looks different/out of place.  Anything that might be an indication that this box was somehow special.  

On a serious note, you really do learn a lot about someone’s life when you sift through all of their stuff.  I found pictures of grandparents when they first came to America, baby pictures, kindergarten pictures, weddings and funeral pictures, diplomas, and found out that the son who was a hoarder was also a Certified Fraud Examiner and received a 100% on his Fraud Examiner exam.  He kept IMMACULATE records of everything.  I have delivery receipts of checks that were mailed to utility companies dating all the way back to 1998.  Absolutely incredible.  I wonder if that was part of what lead to his hoarding.  He kept everything from his job, maybe it led into his personal life too.

In the front bedroom I find some atypical boxes full of antique toy cars, the guy’s CFE 100% award, a radio stockticker (Quotrek Dataspeed, if you’re curious), and a few odd boxes labeled H1 and H2.  Instead of the white file boxes, these are brown boxes, packed up very nicely.  Nicer packaging hopefully means nicer contents.   Maybe H stands for “Happy I own this stuff”. Let’s give it a shot.

Inside the boxes are filled with FedEx shipping envelopes, which are full of manilla envelopes.  Everything is very neatly organized.    I open one of the manilla envelopes and it’s full of magazines. I start to pull one out and immediately realize what I have stumbled across.  I don’t even have to finish the title to know that I am about uncover what, for a kid at this time, could be the find of a lifetime.  

“PLAYB…” YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! We found the stash!!!!!! 

H definitely stands for something a little more than Happy.  For the younger readers who have grown up with the internet and don’t understand the significance, this collection would have been something that you only dreamed about.  The two boxes contained 74 mint condition magazines, 5 calendars, 8 VHS tapes, and 5 newspapers.  Some of the well known brands like Playboy and Penthouse but a whole bunch of other stuff.  I’m not sure of the rules of this subreddit but I can post a NSFW link with pictures.  The way that these items were packaged and taken care of, it was obviously a prized possession.  I quickly pull it up on eBay thinking that this could be the motherload, pun intended, of the things I have found.  Turns out it is the epitome of cool but not inherently valuable.  

The day is winding to a close and I decide to load up what I can to take it to a collector shop to see what money I can get.  Enough things at $5 a piece adds up and hopefully I can at least pay for the cleanup of the unit.  As I walk towards the door, I feel an odd sense of connection to the place. A strangely personal relationship with the previous owners.  I have learned so much about them, their family, their habits.  Standing in the door frame, I turn around to look into the now darkness.  Until next time my friendly friend… Until next time.",realestateinvesting,1644597709

I've started looking through the wiki and existing posts but it may be best for me to just ask some direct questions/ give details of my current situation.

Age 27
Area: Charlotte NC
Income: 180K sole earner
Career: software engineer
Home: owe 270 on a now 450K home(purchased in 2020 area has been booming)
Credit score: 785

2 kids, wife who is a stay at home mom, I have student loans roughly 35k 5ish% apr

25K cash savings(VGSTX) and a couple of paid off cars I could sell for 40-50K


Goal: build a portfolio that can earn me enough money in say 15-20 years that I am not working 75% of my days building some other person's pockets and I can spend time with my family if that makes sense. 


What do you all think is the best course of action? 

Eliminate the student debt then start saving? 

Invest the cash in a rental property?

Wait a couple years to start and keep saving while learning more? Maybe waiting to see if prices dip.

I honestly wouldn't care to liquidate the cars either so I could have roughly 65k to get started. Should I refinance and pull some equity out to work toward my first investment (I wouldn't want to get too much as I do not want to risk my primary residence if that makes sense)

How should I go about getting the first one from what I can see in my area I have a couple of options:

*Tax forclosure auctions
*Buy from a realtor


If I buy a home for sale though will I need 20% down? I'd like to hold on to some cash for repairs/emergency finds I imagine the loan process is different for investment vs primary residence since they asked that during my home purchase process.

I like the idea of house hacking but with kids  it may be tough to start small.

2935,JZKRK,"Messy situation in CA - Where do I stand? - After being threatened with eviction Tenants went behind my back and paid rent to a family member (who is a fractional owner of the rental property, but is not listed anywhere on lease agreement nor has ever been involved in the management of the property)","Hello all,

I have taken over managing an elderly family member's rental properties in California after they experienced a stroke early last year. I have Power of Attorney along with one other person in the family. 

All has been going just fine until recently.  Last month a family member, who is listed as a tenant in common with two other people on one of the rental properties, went over to the tenants of the property and instructed them that all rental payments would now be made to them, otherwise they would seek to evict the tenants. No one in the family was informed of this ahead of time and I only found out recently when I asked about a missing rent payment. (This family member is angry about their eventual inheritance and is causing trouble, however, this is not the focus of this post, just some context). 

For some reason the tenants agreed to this arrangement without first contacting me who has POA and had been collecting rent and dealing with any issues for nearly a year.  

When I asked them, they said they agreed because the family member could show them a deed showing they are a tenant in common with a 50% ownership stake. I do not even know if the tenants were in fact shown any documentation, but they said they were afraid of being evicted. This person claimed that they are the majority owner that the entire rent must be paid to them, not to the person on the tenancy agreement, who is my elderly family member who purchased the property and who the tenants had already been paying rent to for many years. 

The rental income for this property has long been the taxable income of the elderly person despite the tenancy in common arrangement.

This rogue behavior by one family member has taken the rest of us off guard as the income is needed to pay for the care of the elderly person and I am not completely sure where we stand in all of this. 

I have told the tenants that technically the rent for February has not been received under the terms of the lease agreement. I would like them to remain tenants as, apart from this, they have been very good tenants and always pay early. However, if they do not pay rent into the account of the person they have the lease agreement again, I will have no choice but to take action to seek two months of delinquent rental payments. 

The lease agreement in place is between the tenants and the elderly person (whom I have POA for) not anyone else. It clearly states that person should be paid the rent and how and when they should do it each month. Surely just because someone is listed as an owner, they cannot suddenly make the tenants pay the entire rent to them if they are not anywhere on the lease agreement? What takes precedence here - the lease agreement in place or ownership? 

If anyone could possible help me to better understand where I stand legally in all of this it would be greatly appreciated.",realestateinvesting,1644526064

2942,PisgahTime,Converting Second Home to Primary Residence. Already sold actual Primary Residence...,"Sorry if this belongs in r/personalfiniance. I figured folks with real estate knowledge would know better how to answer this predicament. 

Long story short; Wife and I live in TX and got a great opportunity to slow down and start over in NC. Started construction on a house in NC in early 2021, but bank said new projected income from new NC job wasn't sufficient for the loan (which is fine, salary structure ramps up very quickly and we have good savings cushion). They said to classify it as a ""Second home"" instead and use my current TX salary. So we did. 

Fast forward to now. We have sold our home in TX in November and have been temporarily living with in-laws in TX until construction of NC house is completed later this month. The NC Loan Officer told me when we convert from Construction loan to Mortgage it would turn into our Primary residence. It seems that she was WRONG and I should have double-checked that piece of information. Now we have to convert it as a Second Home at some point... Right? Do I have options here?

My question(s) are:

\-Is there a better way than re-closing on a new loan (\~$4k in pointless fees) just to have this house listed as our Primary Residence? Surely there are easier ways to turn this into our primary residence.

\-How do we go about this timeline since we technically don't have a Primary Residence? Do we list my in-laws house in Texas as our primary, but then again I don't know if that's ethical or legal, so I'd like to steer clear of that situation. Seems definitely illegal... Right?

\-When I start working for new employer in NC in March, can I list my new NC address as my permanent address or do I have to list my old TX address? Does it really even matter?

\-Is the IRS going to come after me next year for living in a ""Second House"" for a full year when I don't have a ""Primary House"" to begin with?

Either way, we are going to be fully residing in the house in the next month. I just want to make sure I do this by-the-book. But given the strange situation, I haven't been able to find any similar pieces of advice that directly apply here. 

Thanks in advance, y'all.",realestateinvesting,1644519933

I haven’t been in touch with my parents for the past decade. I just inherited a house on the other side of the country (Columbus, Ohio), and I don’t know if I want to sell it or rent it out. For some background information, I have a degree in finance and have been interested in RE investing for a while. I think this might be a good starting point to my portfolio. I was looking on several real estate sites like Estateza and Redfin and found that the rental estimate for the property is around $1600. There is no mortgage on it and it’s paid in full. The roof was redone, and the basement has been turned into a movie theater and bar. The property is located near Ohio State University so perhaps it would be good for students?

The property was bought in 2016 for 200k. 

Estimates for sell are at $290k (based on a realtor)

So I ran the numbers based on the estateza estimate at $1654 and they are outputting these financials:
Cash flow: $250
Monthly expenses: $1404
Vacancy rate: 5%
Capex: 5%
PM: 10%
Utilities: Paid by tenant
Insurance: $900

I wanted to get some advice. I want to get into real estate to generate passive income. I have been thinking about it for a while and have some friends that are pretty successful. The problem that I have is that haven’t had the salary or the same life situations as they have to get started. I had been caught in some bad job luck. I wasn’t making a ton of money for the last 6 years so I decided to switch careers and now I bring home 80k a year. I had accrued some credit card debt along the way, probably 12k or so I took a personal loan out to get the interest rate from 25% to 5%. During this process of consolidating debt a few months ago, my wife decided that she also wanted a career change which I am totally for. She was making in the 40k range and now once she lands a job in her new field, she should be able to bring home 60-70k per year. We have depleted our savings during these career changes and feel like we are always behind.

Should I buy now and look for a duplex and live on one side and rent the other? Should we buy a single-family with the intentions of moving in a year or two and renting it out to another family?

2996,DrDrexlSpiveyMD,Legal question,"I’m in Florida and I decided to list a piece of property I was sitting on right before all the snowbirds came here for the winter.

It’s a nice piece of property that’s good for someone who wants to build a house, as it’s 3 lots all combined so it’s a smaller marker than single lots that builders are buying up all over the county.

Right off the bat we received a full price offer of 75,000.00.   We were excited til we read the stipulation. They wanted us to hold it for 2 months while they tried to sell property they owned. In other words, take it off the market while they tried to come up with the money. We immediately said no because we didn’t want to risk them not selling their property and we didn’t want to lose the chance to sell it in this insane market while all the snowbirds were here.

They came back and said they wanted it anyway agreeing to full price with a closing 2 months out.

2 weeks later they came back and said the bank only appraised it at 58,000.00 and wanted us to come down to 60,000.00 after we already had a signed contract. We said no and told the realtor to put it back on the market ASAP. I was frustrated because they already knew they didn’t have the money but signed the contract anyway. They again tried to negotiate to 66,000.00 and I said the lowest I would go is 70,000.00 and that’s just because we already lost time in the crazy market. They came back and said they would accept. We made an addendum to the contract for 70,000.00 and they signed the contract again.

3 days before closing they came back trying to get us to lower the price again and when we said no, they pulled out.

Now they want their deposit back, and the title company and realtors are trying to get me to sign the release to give it back and I won’t. It’s gonna go to court.

I’m trying really hard to understand how you can sign legal contract, take my property off the market during prime time to sell it, and there’s no repercussions for it. Am I wrong? I’m not looking so much for ethics and morals and what should happen, I’m looking at legal advice.

If you are, all you have to do is prove it. I was shocked at how easy it was after listening to people like you my whole life and thought it was some gated club I'd be kept out of forever.

There are tons and tons of affordable homes being sold every day. There are homes in some places they are practically giving away. Now let's get to the real root of the problem. You don't want *a home* you want *an expensive home in a very high demand area* simply by right of you saying you deserve it and ignoring what others sacrifice and work for it.

But what do I know, I must just be extremely privileged, being a multiply-disabled part-time restaurant worker with zero family support. Tell yourself whatever you want but if I can do it almost anyone can. The best part is that I would love to help other poor people buy homes and build wealth and communities through house-hacking but typically the response I get is just disgust because I guess apparently the solution to bad landlords and bad property management is to complain about it endlessly instead of buying the buildings and doing better or moving to places you can afford.",realestateinvesting,1644422000

The way I see it, you all are hurting the American people by what you're doing and we need to have regulation at a federal level to limit the wealthy from monopolizing the affordable housing market.

3012,iliketreesndcats,What is good about real estate investing?,"Please let me preface by saying I am genuinely curious and not trying to be rude. I'm looking for perspective from people in this industry about an ethical question.

Hi! I am thinking about buying my first piece of real estate lately, and it's obviously gotten my head into the market. I'm seeing that, adjusted for inflation, house and land prices compared to income is so, so much higher than when my parents and grandparents bought their real estate. 

Not only are the houses reatively poorer quality, the land more polluted, the half-feasible areas so much further away.. but it just seems insane to me that we live with finite property that everybody needs and yet people are permitted to own more property than what they need for themselves and their family.

It's a genuine question, and I don't mean to be rude, but how do you justify owning investment properties? It limits the supply of purchasable property and hikes the prices up to a point where mostly only established owners can afford to purchase more. This is terrible for people trying to live a reasonable life.

I'm a hard worker. I run my own business and work a second job. All I want is to buy rural land and build a house for my family, and yet these goals seem a fairly out of reach!

Why is it that landlords deserve to make money from purchasing property they don't need and then leasing it to someone that needs it?

Do you think that it is more ethical to limit how many houses or parcels of land somebody can own? I've been thinking maybe two would make sense, as it allows for somebody to have a house close to work/for every day living, and a house in the countryside for holidaying and even short term leasing for other holidaymakers.

What would your advice be to somebody looking to buy? I can only think of moving to a less developed country, where my funds are worth comparatively more, and living there - but that gentrifies that area and contributes to displacing those local people who would otherwise buy there.

I bought a town home in 2019 that I currently live in with a 30 year conventional loan at 4.375%. I am moving to the east coast and want to make it a rental property with the LLC I created. The property has 56% LTV and with an estimated 4.5-5% cap rate.

I solicited a local Arizona credit union to refinance the current loan for a commercial loan. The terms are: 5 + 5 for a 10 year term with a reprice after 5 years (5 year TCM plus 300bps) amortized over 25 years at 4.77%. I understand this is a balloon payment and the interest rate is higher. Maximum LTV is 75%.

Or, should I attempt to use a quit claim deed with my current servicer, changing myself to the LLC? This is assuming they won't call the loan if I attempt to transfer it to a LLC. I am wanting to get PMI taken off regardless, which I can do with the refi or an appraisal.

We are trying to figure out what to do with it and have been considering renting it.

Any advice for how to approach this?  There's probably no easy way to have this conversation with someone but I'm just not looking forward to it.  Even worse they are basically in my front yard, although I don't regularly see them or communicate with them due to tree cover.

3043,mediocrerhino,[NY/NJ] Would this qualify as a 1031 “like-kind” exchange?,"My intent is to purchase a multi-family home in NJ as a rental property. I’m currently emptying my parent’s primary residence single family house in a suburb of NYC. The house deed is still in my parent’s name and they live with me. 
Two real estate agents have suggested listing the property for $600K. 

Options we’re considering - I could either:
1) sell their house (obviously we’d have to pay capital gains tax) and use the remaining money to invest in NJ, or… 
2) What if we rent the NY house out for at least a year so it would be considered a rental property (no longer a primary residence), then a year from now 1031 exchange it for a multi-family house in NJ? Sources I’ve read about 1031 usually caution that it can’t be a primary residence.

Before anyone says it:
- Yes, I realize I need to consult my CPA and use a proper 1031 intermediary. 
- And yes, I am capable of doing the necessary property management.
- No, I don’t want to have any investment property in NYC longterm. I’d prefer to be completely out within a year or two.

Questions:
- What are your thoughts about option 2, is it viable? 
- Is a year of being a rental (with proper rent receipts, documents) sufficient to no longer be considered primary residence and eligible for 1031 exchange?
- Do I need to notify any official government entity (e.g., NYC Dept of Finance) of the change in status from primary residence to rental?
- Have you had any personal experience or concerns to share that I should be careful about?
- Anything else I might be overlooking or overthinking?

We found a replacement property that happens to also be in an opportunity zone. 

It's my understanding that a 1031 will defer capital gains taxes, but investing in an opportunity zone will eliminate capital gains tax (after holding the property 9 years). 

Do I need to designate the purchase property on some form to qualify as an opportunity zone investment? Just buying the house there is not enough. Everything I find on Google refers to a Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund, which looks like some type of investment fund with shared pool assets with other investors, and not an actual property that we would be purchasing.

Now here is the thing I bought this house 2 years ago and had it inspected the electrical wiring is fine. I have had no issues relating to electrical during the time I owned it, it even has breakers that are about 5 years old lol ….

I came across a unit that is housed within the hotel of a resort in that area that is available for private ownership. The listed price seems absurdly low though. What is the risk or the catch that I'm overlooking? Here are a few of the details:

\- Unit is in a popular, 4 season tourist destination

\- $700-$800 monthly HOA fee is waived if the owner agrees to put the unit in the rental pool

\- Units participating in the rental pool are fully managed by the hotel (cleaning, marketing, etc)

\- Rental pool participants are paid their portion of rental income twice per year

\- HOA Board determines the need for updating of amenities on site

So what are the risks here? I'd like to get more information on what they charge for property management, but is there also a risk of the Board approving major updates to the hotel and thereby paying the owners lower rental shares each year? They also are stating that they do not share historic rental histories until an approved contract is in place. That a red flag?

I’m looking at 1br condos there right now, and I can get one for $500k-$600k. Depending on HOA, it runs me anywhere from $2600-$3000 a month for everything. I’m using a VA loan with 0% down. First time buying.

Rents in this area for a 1br are only about $2000-$2100. I plan to live in this condo for 2-3 years, and then rent it out, but I’m afraid that’s a stupid move because I’d likely not even be able to get rent that equals my mortgage.

3062,Ghostaware365,What is your advice to homebuyers in the face of higher interest rates since the pandemic in the market to buy?,"Well folks the day has come where the 10 year yield hit 1.958% interest rates doe the 30 year are averaging close to 4.0% getting back to some pre-pandemic levels. For existing home sales many people are competing for homes by offering significantly over asking just to try to get a home before they miss out on a great interest rate. People looking to build face higher base prices on homes and the consequence of waiting until their home is closed to finishing before locking in a rate. 

Let me put out a call for advice to those stuck in between a rock and a hard place on how a homebuyer facing these challenges should move forward. Buy regardless of interest rate because home prices are gonna keep going up or else you’ll be priced out? Let interest rates rise and see if it reduces competition and brings this hyper sellers market back to a normal sellers market? Don’t buy in this market if interest rates are this high?

I'm a 32 yo male, with $140k in total income, $14k in savings specifically for a downpayment on a condo (also have a $10k emergency fund, $5.6k in short-term savings that could also go towards downpayment). 

I'm looking to purchase my first condo in an HCOL area (Washington, DC) and trying to figure out what's the best way to evaluate whether a property is a good deal or not. My short-term goal is to live in it for about 2-5 years, make some minor improvements, then either refinance or sell it to potentially get a multi-family unit.  

I put together this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uVpna-6OoHf2-9Pe3OVEKErCH_nWEX2fLxFjsODXk1Y/edit?usp=sharing) where I compare neighborhoods and subtract the asking price from the average price of other condos in the same building or street to get a rough sense of whether the property is undervalued or overvalued. 

1. Does this make sense or am I missing other important factors that I should be considering when evaluating a property? 
2. How do you evaluate properties?
3. Does this investment strategy make sense? Starting with a condo to get into multi-family?

This was my first time selling a property so I relied on the realtor for a lot of advice. When he first saw the property ahead of listing, he recommended a price of $210k and I agreed since it was in the range of comps that had sold around that time, a month ago. I ultimately ended up accepting a full cash offer for $203k with a waived inspection, at his recommendation before it even hit the open market. This was still above the price of most of the condos that had sold during that time. Well, we just closed last week and 3 days later it shows up on all the platforms listed for sale at $240k. He’s listed as the realtor representing the property. For background this is a 1/1 condo on the water in south Florida.

Am I an idiot for not listing it for more or is this just the result of a crazy and fast moving market? Did my realtor just pull a shady move?

3078,CharlieWellington,Acquiring 100% Hard Money Financing,"The hard money lender I have used structures their loan at 80% purchase price and 100% of renovations. In order to pursue this hard money loan I had to come to the lender with a signed contract first. This initially made me weary about putting a house under contract then potentially not being approved by the lender. However, the lender has repeatedly told me that if I think the property is a ""good deal"" they will finance it. I believe I have a knack for finding what most people would consider a great deal. Now, I am questioning why they would only finance up to 80% as opposed to 100%. For example, if I was to bring them a contract for a property with a purchase price of 100K and they approved me for the loan they would finance 80K. BUT what if I had put the same exact property under contract at 80K? I have been led to believe that they will now only finance 80% of the 80K. Is 100% financing something that I can push for after building the relationship up more? 

My ultimate goal is to keep as much of my money in my pocket as I can by finding someone who will finance 100% if the deal justifies it. I would like to pursue another deal while I am rehabbing this one but, I do not want to use anymore of my own cash (20% purchase price). Which brings me to my next question, what would the lenders concerns be if the property is being purchase at such a low cost that in so many words they couldn't lose? This thought has all come to the front of my mind because I recently purchased a duplex at 135K. I am positive that it can sell in its current condition for north of 200K and with roughly 50K of rehab it can fetch north of 300K. My hard money lender is only financing  80% as previously mentioned. However, why wouldn't they feel comfortable financing 100% or 95% if even they agreed the property is valued at 200K in current condition? They would make more on the initial points charged and the monthly loan payment.  Worst case scenario (or maybe dream scenario for the lender), I default and they take the property. I understand this has additional fees, time and risk attached but all combined they are no where near the roughly 70K of automatic equity that's in the property. From my point of view they stand to make more off of the deal if I do default. 

Please share your thoughts and/or insight on how you would go about procuring 100% financing in this scenario.",realestateinvesting,1644321233

Her and I are 50/50 owners, we both put in 50/50 start up money. Before the housing bubble burst(2007 ish) , her husband was a GC. He doesn’t do any work but had the license necessary to pull permits and had contractors that work for him. Husband has some knowledge about this stuff. 

When we were starting the business husband was not involved. Early on we got a mentor/RE agent/investor that’s teaching us the ropes. Brenda and I and sometimes the mentor would have calls and F2F meetings and no husband. 

1. Eventually, when Brenda and I were on the phone talking business, husband would chime in from the background giving opinion, making suggestions, etc. I did not mind this. Brenda apologized for her husband, explained that he thinks he knows everything, just listen to him and eventually he’ll stop taking. Ok, sure, no problem. 

2. Next Brenda asked if husband can come along to inspect the property. We were with a contractor referred by our mentor. None of us knew the contractor. I was a little shaky but said ok and I’ll see how this goes. Husband came was quiet while partner and I, mentor, and contractor inspected the house. On the ride back home he gave opinion and suggestions. I did not mind this. She apologized again for husband. I didn’t know what for but I’m beginning to get impression that even she’s annoyed by husband but is not gonna do anything about it. 

3. Well today we went to inspect a house, Brenda and I, husband, mentor, and contractor that husband worked with before. I couldn’t hear my mentor over the husband talking to the contractor about the property. Husband was directing the contractor. Contractor was talking to husband as if he was paying for the stuff. Today his involvement crossed the line for me.

I tried and tried but havent found a lender who will do that. They all tell me that I would have to just take out a commercial loan. Which is what I expected. 

I am assuming since he was able to find a lender to do this like 8-10 years ago, times has changed and lenders are not looking to do these transactions anymore. 

I am not looking for whether this is a good idea or not. I am curious if anyone has been able to do this and what lender they used and what their experience was like?",realestateinvesting,1644282510

3111,Idsanon,Using HELOC to protect my equity gained over the past 18 months during the next downturn.,"Real estate investing is not my day job by any means but looking to eventually rent out my 1 br condo in a high cost of living area and purchase 2-3 br unit during the next downturn. Bought my condo in 2018 with about 3% down. Due to it being located in a high cost of living area, the price is skyrocketed over the past 4 years. I am probably sitting on ~$250k of equity. This equity could almost vanish overnight if the 8 figure class homes in the area start to correct. Regardless of what happens in the market, the rents in my area will stay high and continue to rise. 

My initial thought was to just get a cash out refi and sit on the cash (6 months rolling cd's or something of that caliber) but I don't want to lose value on a monthly basis while I wait for a deal to come around (figured that interest income would be eclipsed by inflation on a monthly basis). When I ran this by a friend who owns a brokerage, he told me that I should look into a HELOC. I found one that has a 3.75% var apr (prime + 0.25%) that I can qualify for. 

The play that I'm now conjuring is to secure the HELOC, wait for market downturn, utilize HELOC for a down payment on a new place, rent out my current condo, pay off HELOC. One assumption I am currently running off of is that the prime rate will remain low in the event we have a major correction. 

1) Am I missing anything? 

2) Are there any alternative vehicles I should explore?

1st post here, so here goes. My wife and I purchased something of our dream home in our state a few years ago before the housing market popped off. As of recently, my wife will need to relocate for her job for 3 years. The end goal is to return to this state at the end of her assignment. 

Here’s my dilemma, if I sell this home, I will not be able to afford it in 3 years. Hell, even if I could, I wouldn’t get THIS house back. Our home has appreciated nearly $200k since buying 2 years ago, so I’d bargain to say I couldn’t even afford this house today. 

My current situation: We pay around $2,600 all said and done on the mortgage. By a conservative estimate I could get a tenant in here for $3,300, judging solely by doing my own research on comparable properties. I’m low balling that estimate to really determine if this is even feasible. 

After rental income tax, repairs and maintenance, etc. is that $700 going to be gone with the wind before I ever even see it in my bank account? Any advice as to whether renting is even realistic?",realestateinvesting,1644272376

We’re talking about a duplex. It will be owner occupied, it already has a tenant on the second floor. 
I would to have a second opinion on the this deal:

Price: $520k
RE Tax: $11k
Rent: tenant currently paying $1890 (maybe slightly under market value)
Mortgage: will probably be FHA, given the low cash available.

First floor apartment is bigger (it has a larger living room that could potentially be broken down into a third bedroom). So rent can potentially be higher when I move out ($2500 ish)

3122,mrfreshmint,Which areas of the US do you think will be the best for STRs over the next 10 years?,"I'm sure that many iterations of this questions have been asked, but I was hoping to bring a bit more engagement from OP than previous threads have had.

Generally speaking, if you pick an area like NYC, Bay Area, Seattle, Vancouver, you will be extremely fortunate to break even in your cash flows, STR or LTR. If you pick somewhere like the flyover parts of the Midwest, you will heavily cash flow at a 20%+ ROI for a LTR. I wouldn't try STRs there.

The sweetspot seems to be some area that is undervalued but is on the cusp of a boom. e.g. Austin, Texas 10 years ago. Obviously this is incredibly difficult to predict, but what I am looking for in this thread is good discussion around why investors see various areas as indicative of high future growth.

My personal experience has led me to believe that Phoenix is an excellent area for STR investing. Though there aren't many traditional attractions in the area, it consistently gets quite a bit of tourist and business traffic. From a building perspective, due to how dry it is in the high desert, issues of long-term moisture buildup and rot are of much lower concern than temperate climates. Granted, I do not own or operate any properties in this area, so I can't speak to it from a place of much experience.

Places like Austin, Texas are generally considered to be overbought, and if you purchased now, you'd be overpaying for what you get. However, perhaps there is still a play in San Antonio or somewhere northwest of Austin along the colorado river.

So: Where do you think are the hottest areas for growth where that growth is not yet fully priced in?",realestateinvesting,1644267896

3129,musically_gifted,Turning basement into apartment for rent. Is it worth it? Pros and cons.,"Mom just passed and she left the house for me and my siblings. We don’t want to sell the house, and realistically could continue to make payments on the mortgage ourselves, but would prefer to make some money off the property since none of us will be living there. We don’t feel comfortable renting out the main house but have been toying with the idea of renovating the basement and turning it into an apartment. My moms basement is HUGE but it needs a lot of work.

Pros:
1. It does have 2 separate entrances so if we did rent it out, no one would have to ever come through the main house 
2. Does have several windows 
3. There is washer and dryer there and since we would not be living in the house, the person renting it would have full access
4. There are 4 sections of the basement so it is very spacious 

Cons
1. There’s a huge steam boiler in the basement that takes up a large amount of space. 
2. Not sure if there is radon but we did have the asbestos covered 
3. We have had some rodent issues in the past
4. The basement is old and needs a lot of work. No finished walls. No doors. 
5. There is 2 separate light sources but even still, the basement is very dim

Anyways anyone have experience turning basements into apartments? We are hoping to spend $20-25k on the project but don’t know if that amount is realistic. Also, is this even a good investment? Do people usually rent basement apartments?",realestateinvesting,1644261182

**The house needs a robust remodel and we estimate $1-2m to do so over 1-2 years.** Property taxes will be $75k a year. We would want a construction loan or potentially a HELOC to finance this (maybe a HELOC from our current home to free up the funds).

**LENDER &amp; MORTGAGE** \- Lender will lend $3m if we do 20% down (leaves us $1m short) or $4m with 30% down (technically doable with cash but leaves us stretched for a couple months and maybe inclined to liquidate some of our stock to stay above water. Mortgage would be $25-30k a month. 

**SELL PRIMARY HOME?** \- We might sell our current home once we move in to free up cash and pay down some of the debt, however its a cool spot (just to small) and would rent robustly. 

**WE ARE BASIC FOLKS -** We have only ever bought homes in a 'traditional' way. 20% down, ARM for 5-7years, then refinance into a 30yr fixed when rates are advantageous. Rates now seem like i we should just jump straight into a 30yr fixed and deploy leverage. Even if the market dips hopefully our timeline means we weather this well. Also this house represents a big step up in scale of figures for us and for the next 9 months would stretch us closer to the red-zone than we've been, but the coffers refill by the end of the year and over the next 10yrs of big tech employment we should hopefully receive about 20m in after-tax income (not accounting for appreciation, raises and leveling up). 

**Question is, how do we buy this home. How would you do it given the above? I feel we might be being naive.** 

* Should we take out a line of credit or HELOC against our first home to free up more cash to buy or remodel this second one. 
* Should we just put our current home up as collateral? Or our retirement accounts?
* Should we just liquidate the $240k of big-tech stock gained over the past 2 months and just have that as an emergency reserve?

**Welcome any advice on how to gain and deploy debt in an intelligent way here.**

Or are we crazy for doing this, the markets going to crash, and we should run away quickly?",realestateinvesting,1644212202
3162,Present_Assumption_4,What’s the best way to transfer home from Father-in-law to wife and I?,"TL/DR: What’s the best way to buy/transfer FIL’s house to us?

Hi! My father-in-law is wanting to give us the house he owns. He owes about $150,000 on the house. My wife and I are planning to talk to a real estate lawyer, but I’m trying to gather any info ahead of time. We’re planning on using a tidal company and figured out that my wife and I will own the house and he would just pay us rent, ideally with a lower mortgage payment than what he’s paying now. 

While my FIL is okay with just signing over the tidal over to us and not having us pay anything, my understanding is that the lending company would require the mortgage upfront, which we wouldn’t be able to do. FIL is okay with selling the house to us for the remainder of the mortgage to us.

Basically, what’s the best way to buy/transfer FIL’s house to us?

The idea is that I help put 50% of the down payment, handle leases, credit and background checks and pay for half of maintenance expenses plus help out with labor when I can/needed. He’d handle actually managing the property since he’s going to live on site and repairs/renovations. My half of the down payment would be about 50% of my current net worth because I’m only 22.

It’s now valued comfortably around $390k. I manage my own property and clear about $900/month with great tenants, roughly 4 yrs of ownership. I’d like to keep this property and use the equity to purchase Doors 2 &amp; 3 (targeting $200k-$300k each) but am targeting the Georgia market (where I have family), specifically looking at condos/townhouses in the following areas: Cumming, Alpharetta, John’s Creek, Sandy Springs areas. Property in Colorado has gotten cost prohibitive to realistically expand doors here. I would likely use a PM team to help provide peace of mind, as I have been warned about having doors that are too far away. 

My questions are:

-What are the best ways to leverage my property into Doors 2 &amp; 3?

-Any key lessons learned or advice for having out of state property?

-Can anyone speak from a Georgia perspective on best up and coming areas for equity appreciation?

-At the price range I am targeting, a comparable nice single family home can be had as well, but have been concerned about a tenant being able to keep up with yard maintenance. Am I putting to much stock in having a more turn-key situation with condos and townhouses?

-I had my heart set on Florida, but the market has been bananas and HOA fees get ridiculous. Am I missing something or should I wait for the market to cool with looming interest rate hikes?

3215,Faskill,Is it always a bad idea to rent your primary residence? (as opposed to buying it),"I'm currently living in a very expensive area (Paris suburbs) where home ownership would prevent me from investing elsewhere. The price-to-rent ratio is very bad, with homes costing about 400-500k€ and renting for only about 1000€ a month.

My company gives me a 400€ monthly bonus to pay for housing expenses that only works if I **rent** my primary residence, so I currently only pay 600€ a month in rent out of my pocket. This bonus is supposed to balance the fact that we are required to move often (every 2-4 years) in order to evolve in the company.

Me and my wife (6000€ in combined monthly salary) started real investing about a year and a half ago and we managed to buy 3 apartment buildings (14 units in total, 700k€) in another region which more or less abide by the ""1% rule"". All of these units are profitable. 

Here's the thing : I have just gotten approved for a transfer in Western France, where home prices for a 3-4 bedroom house are between 300-400k€. These homes typically rent for 1200-1400€ a month so the price-to-rent ratio is a bit higher although still far from the 1% rule. 

That being said, if we choose to buy a house, we will loose the monthly bonus which will be about 500€ for a 1400€/month rental.

The bonus and the ease of renting a home as opposed to buying one, especially for such a low duration (2 years in the ""worse case scenario"") are big proponents for keeping on renting our primary residence and investing out of state. 

That being said, we can't help but thinking that we could buy a home and not waste all the rent money, which would also let us customize it to our needs. After moving somewhere else, we could keep renting it and hopefully this would at least cover the mortgage. 

So here's my dilemma, I'm looking forward to hearing the thoughts of more experienced real estate investors!

TLDR : Moving to a place with a 0.04% rent to price ratio, company pays for 500€ out of an average rent price of 1400€ (this bonus only works if I rent). Should I buy a home and increase my portfolio or rent and keep on investing out of state?",realestateinvesting,1644158833

I just want to hear what is a reasonable and logical calculation for each parties from sale proceeds of a property. I do think its reasonable to distribute the profit according to the amount of work/ distribution made towards investment. 

 3 parties are involved in a profit distribution from selling investment property.

A provided initial downpayment for pre-construction home but couldn't arrange the second mortgage.(20%)

B arranged the mortgage alone for the property on the closing. B managed the property with tenants for 10 years while paying market rental for one of the units. (En-suite landlord)

B payed for all legal fees/cost for refinancing the property which is under his name . B used the HELOC money to re-invest in a pre-construction home and paying the interests.

C lived in one of the units and payed market rent. 

Property was bought for 500k and now worth 1.1mill. On the verge of selling the property there is a dispute between each parties to claim their own margin of profit.

How should the profit get distributed?

Should A get the most for the downpayment ?

Should B get the second most for arranging the mortgage and proeprty managing for years?",realestateinvesting,1644158029

3245,noicedeb8r,Where to invest from someone living in nyc,"At a cross roads of WHERE to invest

So I am pretty young and have about 25k saved up and have 3 years of work history and currently go to school. I live in New York City (Harlem)and currently am on section 8 in an apartment building where the government pays a portion of our rent and SSI gives us a portion where we pay, so I don’t have any real expenses.

Currently, my dad owns a triplex in the Bronx, NY and rents out all 3 units and he manages it himself, and is now valued at close to 1.1m

I want to get another property and rent it out, but we are torn on where to get it. On one hand, I want to get a duplex or triplex in Scranton, PA and have it be managed by a Property Management company because I was researching the rents and they are decent and the property values are affordable in my eyes. I have been listening to podcasts about property management but that’s my idea, plus I don’t need an absurd amount.

My dad’s idea is to get a property in the Bronx under 900k that has 7+ beds and rent it out, but I told him that for most properties like that you need either a commercial loan which requires a big down payment or just a big Down payment altogether. If we do this method, my brother, dad, and I would go all in where altogether we have close to 100k but I have some doubts:

- nyc is a tenant friendly state and our current property, he has had issues of tenants not paying rent and being difficult to evict (but all we would need is a well written lease I think)
- Rarely any 3 or 4 plexes are less than 900k in the Bronx
-We need at least 20% down for most which we don’t have

Anyone have any ideas on what I should do; we both have ideas on owning rental properties but have differences in where; my dad is against other areas other than nyc because we will barely make a profit innScranton versus the bronx, but I want to own and get started as soon as I can.",realestateinvesting,1644089108

3249,stvaccount,Anyone want to mentor me on my first buy (beach condo?),"I have researched the Spanish market for three years. Last year I bought land. Also, I almost bought a three bedroom condo for 101000.00$, but I did not know the market well enough and was only willing to pay 3000$ less than they wanted. In hindsight, I should have bought that penthouse not far from the beach.

Now I want to buy a condo next week. It is by all means very good, 40 yards from the beach. It is a one bedroom beach penthouse (condo). It is in a prime location, much better than the one from last year, close to the beach and restaurants, very quiet street. Only drawback is that the building is old, from 1973. I want to use it for myself and rent it out in the summer.

The real estate agent of the seller is according to four different people from the street/shops in business since 1983 and the most reliable/honest in the area. All high praises. Is that a good sign?

My question is how careful should I be? I’m already, according to friends, a bit over correct and triple checking everything (plans, finances of the building). They say I aim for 100% certainty, which is impossible.

Now I have hired two lawyers and the local one trusts the agent of the seller and wants to do a pre contract with the agent, who has a simple power of attorney to sign contracts. The second lawyer (not local) is uneasy about the signing without notarized power of attorney from the agent. Spanish bureaucracy is behind and in comparison to the USA or more developed countries in the EU. The local lawyer wants to do things the Spanish way, which means there is a tiny chance that I will lose 10% of the sale price (10000.00$) in the pre-contract.

Also, the agent doesn’t like me to contact the seller directly, even though I have now the sellers e-mail. Does it make sense to ask the seller directly if there is anything wrong with the condo? That would make suing later possibly easier. But I mean how much wrong can there be with a condo? If the roof needs repairs, it would be shared by around 50 neighbors.

3267,Sunbro888,Can someone break down the logistics of why real estate is worth it?,"So this is my understanding, let's say hypothetically I put 20% down on a 265k house (my area is low COL/San Antonio). Boom, 52k out of my pocket. Now from my understanding the REAL value in real estate is having the renter pay off my mortgage (so paying for the cash in full and renting it out isn't the move from what I understand). 

So assuming I can get a near 3% interest rate, I am looking at about 1417 a month in expenses between:

Insurance and property taxes (fairly high in Texas)

The market here seems a bit odd in terms of how much I CAN rent out this house for but let's say conservatively I find a renter for 2k a month. I net nearly 600$ monthly. That comes out to around 7200 a year; of which, I should set aside 1% for repairs, which nets me 4550 in profit annually. 

Factor in appreciation of the home at 3% annually and that's another 7950$ in profit (unrealized gain). 

My only mental blocks here are trying to see the forest for the trees. Essentially, in my head I am taking on a liability or rather, an obligation, of owing the bank 1400$ a month, which causes me anxiety to think I am in debt/have to fulfill that obligation. That said, I do not know how hard it is to get a tenant, how often repairs (especially expensive ones occur), and how to ""pad"" this burden from suffocating me.

I have around 100k that I could put towards this and could possibly take out a small mortgage too.

3277,realjohntreed,Should you ever pay down a mortgage when you do not have to?,"Should you ever pay down a mortgage when you do not have to?

# Your return on paying down is the mortgage interest rate

When you pay down a mortgage, the **return** on that investment is the **interest rate on the mortgage**. On a three percent mortgage, paying it off earns you 3% in the form of money you no longer have to pay. Not super exciting. It appears in today’s *Wall Street Journal* that you can get a yield of 2.27% on GNMA bonds.

# Don’t pay down during inflation

In today’s monetary situation, which has **inflation** and may get more, you probably should **NOT** pay down a mortgage. Your **real interest rate** is the nominal rate (the interest rate printed on the mortgage) minus the inflation rate. At present, the inflation rate is 7.0%. If your mortgage is, say, 2.9%, your real interest rate is 2.9% - 7.0% = -4.1%. **“Paying” a negative interest rate is a good deal for you** the borrower. 

You should **not** pay off a mortgage on which you “pay” negative interest because inflation is paying it off for you. 

Inflation hurts you if you own dollar-denominated assets like cash or bank accounts or bonds like a mortgage where you are the lender. If you own **real estate free and clear**, inflation **neither hurts nor profits** you. The price of your property will go up, but so will the price of everything else. So in terms of purchasing power, no change. 

# During inflation, a mortgage makes you a real profit

Ah, but if you own **mortgaged** real estate, you **profit** from inflation. How so? Say you own a $500,000 property with a $400,000 mortgage at 3%. Further say there is inflation of 7% per year for three years. That will take the dollar price of the property to $500,000 x 1.07 = $535,000 x 1.07 = $572,450 x 1.07 = $612,522. That means who used to cost $500,000 to buy now costs $612,522—22.5% more. Conversely, it means that it now takes $400,000 to buy what used to take only $326,000. In other words, the real value of your $400,000 mortgage has fallen to $326,000. 

The property going **up** in dollar value from $500,000 to $612,522 did **not** make you better off because the purchasing price of **everything else** went up the same, It just kept you **even**. But the purchasing power of your mortgage dropping from $400,000 to $326,000 **does** make you $400,000 - $326,000 = $74,000 **better off in real (after adjustment for inflation) terms**. 

During inflation, you would be **crazy** to pay down or pay off a mortgage whose interest rate is below the inflation rate. When you **owe** money, inflation makes you **wealthier** **after** adjustment for inflation.

# Do pay down a mortgage on a principal residence in an unlimited exemption state if you may get into financial difficulty

Here is another circumstance where you **would** want to pay down a mortgage. If you get into financial difficulty, and may have to declare **bankruptcy**, you want to own a **principal residence** in a state that has an unlimited dollar limit on the homestead bankruptcy exemption. There are seven such states and DC. They are AR, DC, FL, IA, KS, OK, SD, TX. If you go bankrupt there, your creditors cannot get one penny of your principal residence equity no matter how much it is. Many have moved to such states to benefit from that.

In that case, you would want **as much of your net worth in that principal residence equity as possible** so you would not have to watch the bankruptcy court turn it over to your creditors.

You say you do **not plan** to go bankrupt? Wonderful, but that is exactly what everyone who ever went bankrupt said beforehand. If you have principal residence equity in one of those states, you have free bankruptcy insurance with no deductible on that equity. That **could save you millions** of dollars.",realestateinvesting,1644035437

Looking for advice on whether I should sell or rent out my 1 bed condo. In a suburb of a medium size city that is seeing great growth (recent boom in home prices and new construction of luxury apartments). Purchased in 2019 for $270k, currently owe $205k at 2.8% interest, estimated selling price between $300k-$310k. Monthly expenses total $1600, estimated rental price of $1800. I realize that this is not much cash flow, but I would also see a principle pay down of $5000/year and anticipated appreciation of at least $10,000/year. The potential for maintenance or large repairs is also very minimal, which I see as a factor in favor of renting as a first time landlord. My monthly expenses includes a recent increase in HOA fees due to a roof replacement. All exterior, as well as hvac/hot water maintenance are covered by condo fees. I don’t need the cash out of it for anything right now, I would just stick it in an index fund.

The property was listed as 1156sqft when I bought it and was appraised at the same. Records show that even the buyer before me bought it at the same sqft. So there have been 3 different appraisals of the house which all concluded it was 1156sqft. The current appraiser said that it was done wrong all those times and any area under 5ft of height can not be counted. The area in question is the bedroom/loft and he is only measuring the middle where it’s over 5ft as the ceiling is slanted on both ends. This will reduce the sqft of the house to 983 sqft which will obviously impact the price and the house will not be appraised. 

My question is, is there anything that can be done about it in terms of the previous appraisals? We want to sell the house but definitely don’t want to take a 30-50k hit from the asking price (we are still waiting for the appraisal report).

3292,WidemanEating,Investing in Single Family Homes with 0% down payment,"A little background: I live in a high cost of living area where SFH prices have appreciated greatly over the 20 years since my parents bought their house. There are also many out of date homes, and land accounts for much of the property value. The demographics are starting to shift more towards wealthy young professionals who value high quality housing. Therefore, there are many construction companies in our area.

My dad often has half baked ideas on business ventures that he doesn’t really pursue. His newest plan is that he can buy a $1 million house and teardown and rebuild a house for $500k, through working with a construction company, that will eventually sell for $2 million.

My mom is the only income in the house and she doesn’t make enough to justify taking on another $1 million of debt or put any money down. Also, she is not on board with his plan so she isn’t fronting any money.

When I asked how he will finance this project, he said that he will explain to the mortgage banker his idea and get a 100% financed loan to purchase the property, plus open up a line of credit to use throughout the construction process. He will also negotiate the terms with the banker so he doesn’t
make any payments during the construction process. The appeal to the lender will be that they will make about $100k in interest, paid back from my dad after the property is sold. The lender has “virtually zero risk” because they can just foreclose and take the house if construction halts or he cannot sell it before an agreed upon date.

I have somewhat of a background in real estate having done a real estate development and finance program as my second major in college, and working at a residential mortgage lender for a few months. 

Therefore I find it incredibly hard to believe that a lender will offer someone with no experience or capital a 0% down loan, given the only value they are bringing to the project is having found the property. There are stricter rules post financial crisis that lenders must follow, right? 

Furthermore, what is stopping a lender from working directly with a more established construction company that has a whole team doing site identification? 

I have never heard of this approach to real estate investing and I don’t see him being successful because all of his research is being done on Zillow. 

When I bring up my concerns for the project he just retreats and turns the discussion to some aspect of his idea unrelated to the downsides I’ve brought up. 

I want to know if this is an actual strategy that is being used by other investors. It feels a little like listening to a conspiracy theorist who takes an actual fact or event from reality and uses it as the basis for some absurd claim with layers of bs.",realestateinvesting,1644015258

We are tracking hours worked so we have a good idea of the amount he has invested, so to speak. We have an agreement that he will receive a cut of the profit as pay.

I have two concerns I haven’t been able to figure out through internet research. 

One is pay- if he’d normally charge $20 an hour for light handyman work, what would be a proper payout upon sale? I would think to pay a bit more (how much idk) and still calculate hourly. Let me know if there is a simpler way to draft this agreement in advance. We’re not sure how much work will be needed over the next year. I plan to sell in June 2023. Would there be a form of “partnership” that would make sense if we wanted to do this a couple times a year?

The other: For everything to be 100% legitimate how do I report or document this pay? Would I need to “hire” him as a contractor? Would he need a 1099K?

TLDR: I’m flipping a house and my friend is helping with the renovation and has agreed to get paid upon the sale, in 1.5 years. How should I calculate what to pay him upon the sale?

I found this deal through a wholesaler on FB.  It's in a historic near where I live that I've always wanted to buy a property.  It's a shotgun (New Orleans Style) duplex.  Only 1200sf total with 1 bed/ 1 bath on each side.  I negotiated a 3-month bond for deed from the wholesaler who originally purchased it, then got a construction loan from a local bank.   After the renovation was complete, I refinanced again into 30-yr freddy/fanny loan.  We did a cash out refi and got all my cash out except for \~$15,000 (renovation cost much more than expected).  We renovated just about anything you can think of with this place.  It was a disaster.  The foundation was so bad it felt like walking in a fun house.  New panel, new roof, refinished the floors, brand new HVAC system in both sides, etc.  I originally planned to rent it out to long-term tenants ($850 &amp; $950), but a friend of mine convinced me to test out AirBnb with one side, so I gave it shot.  I had a long-term tenant on one side and Airbnb'd the other side.  The Airbnb rental is much more work ( also much more enjoyable), but the numbers are WAY higher than I expected!  I anticipated getting around $1200-$1500/ month average (rather than $950 for a long term tenant).  We haven't had a single month below $2,000 and a few months right at $3,000 for just the one side.  When Hurricane Ida hit, we had a good bit of damage to the side with the LTR, plus his job moved him to another state, so we ended up converting that side to Airbnb also.  Here are the numbers so far:

Purchase price: $79,900

Renovation: $65,000

Airbnb decor/ Furniture: $14,000

3311,Double__A_Ron,HELOC Funded -- Thanks All,"So this story falls into the category of ""unconventional house hack""...

Started trolling this sub a in June 2019 with almost no money to my name but a desire to leverage real estate to grow my net worth.

By June 2020 I had just enough to purchase a small SFH (on almost no land) with 5% down in a rapidly growing market. In hindsight, this was my last ticket to affordability in this particular city with the year that followed in the housing market. I remember almost backing out of the deal for fear of going underwater with only 5% down. However, I stuck with the principles of being confident in the rent comps I had pulled and the home was affordable *to my situation.*

I spent much of the pandemic living in the house, ""re-surfacing"" it with paint on everything you could see, as well as other cosmetic updates. A vast majority of this was done DIY (by yours truly) and with a planned budget. I sacrificed a lot during this period and nearly drove myself insane, but it gave me satisfaction in knowing that I was building a formula for how to grow wealth completely independently. I will admit, I absolutely need a better network to leverage because it is damn hard to be the house painter, AND the down payment funder.

By April 2021 my home was finished and comfortable enough to host guests in on Airbnb. From this point forward I began splitting my time at my home and renting it out as a short term rental while away (I'm rather comfortable on the road). For 2021, I came in about cash-flow neutral - thats including a place to occupy 2/3 of the year. Not a bad house hack IMO. Many of my guests were multi-week guests in need of temp housing due to relocation or house hunting. Guests found it to be a great value and grateful for a livable home during an otherwise uncertain period.

So now here in February 2022, my 5% equity grew to 35%. Thanks to my cool 2.65% FR 30-year mortgage, a cash-out refi was completely off the table. So I decided to tap this equity using a HELOC. 

I can already hear the mobs wishing for my credit demise as this (extremely) rapid equity growth is in fact a sign of ""the crash"". That very well may be the case, however, my strategy is to only use this HELOC for the *cash* purchase of another entire deal - i.e., no mortgaging until I am ready to recoup my investment and move onto the next property. This way, I am only ever levering one property at a time. I'm a bit uneasy about the idea of using the HELOC as a downpayment for a mortgaged property, though it is tempting. This does however put me into an entirely different property profile in order to purchase in cash using only HELOC and personal funds. 

Only the future will tell what kind of success I will have there, but thank you /r/realestateinvesting for helping me *get* *into the game*.

I know there are strong feelings about Airbnb and type of profit it creates, but I want to offer an anecdote to those similar to me in June 2019 looking for an entry into REI.

3327,Nadallion,What would you do in my situation?,"Hi all,

I recently renovated a condo I got for a very good price and benefited from an explosive housing market. The property has appreciated a tremendous amount (6-figures) in a few months. My dilemma is, I don't really have a better alternative to put the money I make into.

If I were to sell, I would pay capital gains and a 5-figure penalty for breaking my mortgage which is something I would like to avoid if possible. wrt the re-financing route, the property would barely make any money if not lose me money if I were to rent it.

I understand the whole hold as you may experience further appreciation. I also think where this condo is located this is very possible - the area is in a very tight housing crunch and is exploding in population with geographical restrictions preventing more building in the city.

I don't want to sell and miss out on 10-20% further appreciation, but for some reason, I don't like the idea of struggling to find a tenant to barely cover my costs. I also don't want to sell and have that money just sitting in my bank account.

I also am in a slight liquidity crunch - nothing severe or scary, but it would be comforting to have this money in the bank. The investor in me just hates selling appreciating, inflation-proof assets to have peace of mind knowing the money is there instead of existing but being tied up.

After keeping my eye on local listings for a few years, I’ve come across what I believe to be the first potential “great” deal I’ve ever seen listed - a moment I’ve been waiting for. The problem is, I’ve never been prepared to act on it when the time came and have very little cash to put down on a down payment.

My question to you:

Has anyone every structured a deal where they receive equity in exchange for property management/essentially everything other than the cash?

3330,caverunner17,Denver: Rent vs Sell SFH?,"House: 3/2.5 in suburban Denver. Bought in 2017 for $330k, current neighborhood comps are $525k. Owe \~$240k at 2.875%. Monthly mortgage/taxes/insurance/HOA is about $1450. 

House has had a lot of interior renovations we did, however we likely need a new roof (10-12k), a handful of windows (3-5k), new exterior paint (5k), and likely a new water heater (1k) within the next 5 years. 

Rental comps are roughly $2500. 

$2500-10% (PM company) = $2250-1450 = $800, less $350/month set aside for repairs = $450/month profit + roughly $450/month mortgage equity (at present) makes $900 in gains/month or $10,800/yr

Plan is to move in the same area to a larger house that's about $625k. Non-retirement investments could cover an additional 20% downpayment (though we'd be somewhat thin on non-retirement assets for the short term). Opportunity cost of $125k downpayment taken out would make a 7% average gain of $8,750

In theory, renting would net me an additional $2050/year

Risk, of course is the housing market crashing, thus losing equity if we sold, months with no tenants, other unknown repairs, etc.

So I just got a rental. The rental is in the current state of New Jersey in the Atlantic county area. We bought it around 2 months ago with a tenant. Their current rent is 1850, they have been their for 5 years. Right now market rent in is more like $2600. They are on a month to month lease. When we purchased it we spoke to them about giving them 3 months to vacate and charging them only 1850, if they dont move out by then, it would be increased to 2200. Now as the deadline is approaching, they said they cant move out, because they cant find a property they want/afford. They also refuse to pay the rent increase stating they cant afford it.

They are a spanish speaking family, so we didnt have it in writing. We had the daughter translate for us. (i know it was stupid). What would you guys recommend the best course of action is? Also how do you know if the area has a rent control, i tried googling it but couldnt find anything, tried asking a few realtors and they dont know about it. (im about to speak to an attorney within the week and when inquiring that was one of his questions).

Overall the house is great and undervalued for the area. I knew going into this, the tenant may become a potential problem but its one of the reason why it was undervalued.

TL;dr: Do short term home placement agencies rent on behalf of their clients and in the agency/rep name instead of the client’s


I have a newly renovated 60 day minimum rental property in a very active market in South Carolina. 

I just posted it for rent for the first time about a week ago, and I had my first booking request today through Air bnb.

It is for 90 days; perfect size house for a family who needed it while their house is being renovated.

My property manager hasn’t actually spoken to the family; only a home placing service.  They say that they book on behalf of the family, because they work directly with insurance. Also, she says that the booking would be in the company/agent name, but we would have all of the tenant information.

Lastly, she says they will pay monthly, but want us to keep it off market while it is being rented because they don’t know if the Reno might stretch past 90 days. 

I’m new to this style of rental; so I have no idea what scams are being run yet.

I work in urban sustainable design (think food forests, urban agriculture, etc.) and the next phase in my career will probably involve acquiring some multifamily units (small, like mostly duplexes, maybe even some SFH) and slowly retrofitting them with solar, etc. on the path towards founding an ""ecovillage"" in my town.

Long term there are many different ownership models I am exploring for how this will ultimately develop, but in the short to medium term the most straightforward thing will be to just fill the units under conventional rental agreements. I'll offer below market rates wherever I can make them pencil out, and likely some other eccentric things like mandating that a % of rent paid goes towards maintenance of edible landscapes shared in common across properties.

This is convoluted but here's the real question: when I'm just starting out I want to make these units available first and foremost to people who I know will be willing to help in the establishment of the ecovillage concept.

This is the first time I’ve looked at a property large enough that I thought it might justify keeping them onsite rather than using the PM company I have all my other properties with. Has anyone been down this road? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I own 94 doors currently and My largest property up to this point is a 26 unit with most being less than 10 so this would be a big step up for me in several ways.,realestateinvesting,1643902786

3383,MonsieurJune,Cash Out Refi or HELOC for cash to BRRR?,"Quick question. I’m a high income individual and just remodeled my primary home. There is plenty of equity &gt; $400k from the remodel and because I live in central TX. I’d like to BRRR into an investment property but I’m having a hard time determining if it’s better to do a cash out refinance or take out a HELOC to fund the initial capital required.

My existing mortgage is $230k principal balanc @ 3.875% with a monthly payment of $1,184.62. 

The cash out refinance would change the balance to $430,904 @ 3.375% netting me $194,216.49 to use as the cash for buying an investment property. My 30yr mortgage payment would change to $1,905.01.

OR

Should I do a traditional refinance to lower my existing interest rate and take out a HELOC to fund the BRRRR.

I plan to pay in full cash either way to buy the property and after doing a cash out refinance on the investment property my plan would be to continue to BRRR into additional properties.

3384,RadtechFTW42,Thinking about buying a duplex,"I currently rent a townhome in Upstate NY for $1080 a month, that will be increasing $20 every year until $1200+. So for awhile now I have been looking for a SFH, however decided to look into buying a duplex instead in hopes that the rental income will help with payments. (That wasn’t the only reason, but mainly because this could be a good investment for me). I found a 1900 sq ft, side by side duplex a little out in the country on TWO acres of land but only 10 minutes away from where I live now for $180,000. There is already tenant in one side who takes immaculate care of the place, and “religiously” pays rent, $750 monthly and is locked into a yearly lease until 12/2022. Her side is entirely updated and needs no work. The vacant side where I would be living in, needs a bit of cosmetic work but is liveable. To move into this I would actually be downsizing. The rooms are tiny, the kitchen is very small and needs a lot of work. Is an “investment” that could appreciate over time and get me possible cash flow SOMEDAY worth all of this work and giving up my extra space that I have now? I would be paying $550 monthly for my mortgage which is another bonus. I was also approved for a loan that is zero down and no PMI (a bit higher interest) so that’s also why this is tempting. I also want to mention I’m a first time home buyer AND landlord and have absolutely no experience with anything, especially maintenance related. 

In short: Is it worth all the work to invest in a duplex to only be paying half of what I pay now, and giving up an apartment I adore? My main concern is despite being able to save money, not feeling “at home” in my duplex.",realestateinvesting,1643888974

3386,tagfty,Seeking Advice,"This is my first year using this PM co. They came highly recommended, but I’m growing in discomfort. Are these par for the course, or should I look elsewhere?

They charge 50% first month’s rent for leasing fee, plus 10% management fee per month (including the first month, where they’ve already taken 50%). Then, they charge 10% of the cost of work done to coordinate any work. So, what does the management fee cover, then? They also sent an email out last night saying effective immediately, they will be charging $50 to coordinate insurance inspections, and if a landlord has to be there, another $50 fee. Keep in mind, this company also does remote viewings — meaning they give the clients a code to go in and view the property themselves. No agent is there with them.

The company withholds the last month’s rent from the owner to cover turnover costs. Shouldn’t that be covered by the tenant’s deposit?

One month they took in less rent than the tenant is supposed to pay. No explanation was given. I had to inquire what the deficit was, and found out it was gutter cleaning that the tenant paid themselves and deducted from rent. Maybe I’m wrong, but that seems like an unprofessional approach. Does this mean the tenant reached out and the pm hadn’t been responsive? The other concerning part of that particular situation is that the PM, which is supposed to get 10% of rental income, added an additional fee to take them back up to their usual income amount.

I live in another country now, so I feel a bit unsettled and uncomfortable with the company, but it’s not going to be easy to handle firing and rehiring from 4,000 miles away.",realestateinvesting,1643880499

My wife and I are pretty over this cost and realize that were just burning money by staying here. The goal is to live for free or close to free, that way we save up money quicker to buy more investments. I started looking for a 4plex to purchase. Live in 1, rent out the other 3.

So if we do the math, buy a sub 1 million dollar 4plex. For this example, let's say the price is exactly 1 million. Using FHA 3.5% down (35,000. My credit is excellent +800 so idk what the best interest rate is but let's say 3.384%. According to the Redfin calculator, my mortgage will be around $6099 / Month.
Cant we live in 1 unit and rent out the other units for $6099/3= $2099/month per tenant, if not more? Technically we'd be living for free no?

Now I know it's not that black and white, but what kind of costs am I missing from this calculation. Am I close to living for free or is there like 1k or 1500 dollars per month hidden cost hiding somewhere? The goal is to live in this place for a year or two and then rent out the 4th apt. Use this property's equity to buy another property or sell it and move on.

3397,dap12036,Advice on whether to sell or keep.,"I’m debating whether to sell or keep my condo that I’m renting out. Details:
Purchased it as a foreclosure in 2010 for $230k. 
Remaining mortgage of $145k. 
Can sell for $275k - $300k. 
2 bedroom, 2 bathroom condo. 
HOA fee of $525 per month. 
Net profit of $200 per month. 

Reasons for selling:
Property/area hasn’t appreciated as I thought it would, both for property values and rental price. 
Demographics have changed, as it’s a relatively affordable unit in an otherwise high cost of living area. 
Roof will need to be replaced at a cost of $1M in the next 5 years. Reserve is currently at $300k. 
All my friends and acquaintances that lived in that area/building have sold in the past few years. None made any profit when selling. 
New property management company is bad/inept in comparison to the old management company that was there for 15 years. 
New rental building with nicer amenities opened up recently, just down the street. However, a unit similar to mine would rent for $3k. 
It has close to 90 units in the building, which is a big liability for the quality of life within it, especially when the demographics are changing. 


Reasons for keeping:
HOA fee is tax deductible, around $6.5k per year. Even if there’s a special assessment, that would also be tax deductible. 
I get free DIRECTV access due to it being provided to each unit. 
I still net a $200 profit per month. 
It is a very low maintenance unit. Most things are still relatively new and or in great condition. 
Getting new tenants doesn’t seem to be an issue, so relatively low vacancy. 
Even though property values don’t seem to be increasing there, I still bought at a great price and don’t think it’ll ever go down to my purchase price. 
When the mortgage is eventually paid off, it will provide higher monthly net profit. 
There is a rental cap, and I am one of the few owners that can rent out my unit.

3402,courtney_lyn,PM Contract Nonrenewal Inquiry,"In early 2021, due to grad school &amp; pressures of work, I opted to enter a one-year agreement with a property management company. I signed the contract in late January, and it lasted exactly one year, so it just expired a few days ago. Because I had so much on my plate at that time, I remembered incorrectly and thought that the contract was good for an additional month.

I happened to check the contract a few days before it expired and immediately reached out to the property management company to tell them that I would not be renewing, for numerous reasons including incompetency. When I did not hear back for several days, I notified my tenants that I would be self managing and to send rent payments direct to me as of 2/1.

I finally heard back this morning from property management saying that they can not honor my request until March, because they require an advance 30 day notice per the contract terms. I went back to the online filing system where the signed document was stored to check the fine print, and they had removed it, which seems very shady to me. I don't believe I have a saved copy anywhere (lesson learned).

My question is, can property managers legally require a 30-day notice of a nonrenewal? I understand for a termination, but I don't see how choosing not to renew should require a full 30 day notice. If they are telling the truth, I'll abide by it but this creates a messy situation since my tenants are already sending rent payments directly to me...so advice for how to best handle this situation would be helpful, too.",realestateinvesting,1643857830

3409,blueblur1984,What are my duties to divorcing tenants?,"I have two tenants that have been very good tenants for the last four and a half years but I just got notice that they're splitting.  I want to be fair with them but I'm a little gun shy with issues like this causing good tenants to go bad...their neighbor in the duplex went through something similar and after years of swapping room mates they stopped paying completely.  It was a total waste of time and money trying to save that tenancy once one of the lease holders moved out.  We're in Sacramento county California and keeping it vague until I can get a consult with our attorney, but here's what I'd like professional opinion on.  Any input or questions I'm missing?:

One of the tenants has already moved out and put in a 30 day notice.  They want to know how much of their security deposit they'll get back.  My thought is nothing until the unit is vacated by all parties...I don't know what the damages are.  They're also married in a community property state so any liabilities incurred by either party are joint debts until the marriage is legally ended, right?

The other tenant wants to stay, but I don't want to do the room mate shuffle.  That's always been a losing proposition from my experience because every issue they have with each other tends to wind up in my email.  Do I have to let one of the tenants out of their lease without both vacating?  If one leaves can I make the other go too?  No fault evictions are dicey here but I seriously doubt the tenant that wants to remain would qualify for a new lease on her own.

My last concern is I've never gone through this with a married couple before.  Are their any legal pitfalls like dispensation of the security deposit or final walkthrough I need to be mindful of?  The divorce seems to be amicable but I imagine it's one piece of bad news away from getting nasty.",realestateinvesting,1643851965

I own a townhouse in a MCOL city and my neighbor mentioned that they were planning on putting their home on the market and moving, so I thought there may be an opportunity to buy it off market, lower than market - they avoid using a realtor and I pay less than it would go for on the market. 

I’m planning on using the property as a rental (haven’t decided on short term vs long term yet) and brought the idea up with my parents. My dad is retired and looking for things to do, so he offered to split it the purchase with me and he would manage it. We would essentially go in 50/50 on the down payment and the costs to furnish it etc.

My question is around the pros/cons of the different ways to structure the deal. We could each afford to purchase it individually (it’s 550k so 110k down), we could create an LLC for the rental business and purchase it in the name of the company, we could do some sort of family trust. If it matters, my parents income is from a small business whereas I have W2 income. I have a current mortgage, they do not (if it matters as far as getting a loan). 

I’m not really worried about custody disputes or potential relationship issues that I typically would be co-buying, so the concerns would primarily be around what is financially and structurally most advantageous. 

As far as I know, the options would be as follows:
1) Either parents or I buy it personally and we share the costs of running the rental
2) We create an LLC and use the company to buy it
3) We jointly purchase not using an LLC 
4) Purchase through a trust",realestateinvesting,1643848068

Looking for advice, please.

I moved to a new area and purchased a home through a real estate agent in the summer of last year. To be honest, the agent wasn't very good at finding homes.  He basically hooked me up with his Realtor.com portal, but left it to me to troll through the listings. I also trolled through Zillow, Trulia, etc. and found the property that I eventually purchased with him as my buyer's agent.

I find myself in the position of looking for another home now and it is the same thing where I'm the one scouring the internet to find a good match, but he's the guy who arranges for the showings. To be honest, he has taught me a lot about what to look for in properties. It took some prodding on my part, but he started revealing to me things to look out for in terms of the structure, signs of wear, etc. He's been a good resource for me now that I have moved to a new climate where houses are constructed differently than where I am originally from.

Having said all of that, I found a FSBO that I am going to go take a look at tomorrow. The part owner of the single family home is also a real estate agent and he is not going to list it until after I take a look at it in case I want to put in offer in on it. Assuming that I do want to put an offer in on the home, what is fair for the real estate agent with whom I have been working thus far? I found this property on my own, but I feel that he has met me to show me see probably at least 20 properties so far and I've learned a fair amount from him so I feel like he should be paid in some way. What do you suggest? Many thanks in advance for your opinions!

P.S.  how much is the seller likely to be saving by selling to me directly vs listing it on the MLS?

3428,BuDongSanWang,Help with minimum quality standards,"I’m currently pursuing cheap, tenant occupied, SFH rental properties in small town Georgia. I’m ok with taking on occupied low income properties right now. None of my targets are currently section 8 or other programs. These are/will be all-cash purchases. 

1. I am interested in the lessons that will come with a low income project and screening in-place tenants. 
2. The metrics for cashflow appear workable.
3. The overall price point (cheap) minimizes some kinds of risk. 

One of my reasons for pursuing tenant occupied assets is the theory that an occupied property probably needs little up front work to achieve/continue the existing cashflow. Not turnkey exactly, but I’ve have been hoping for minimal required work which can mostly be deferred until the units turn. 

Because the properties are occupied, I don’t learn a lot about the condition of the properties until I’m under contract. When I do get under contract, inspections are finding stuff that’s pretty bad. Or at least, it seems that way to me. I don’t have a background in construction or renovation, so I will be relying on experts (GCs, inspectors) to assist in qualifying the properties. That said, I’m working to learn as much as possible so that I can both interpret what the experts tell me and have a chance of telling when I’m getting taken for a ride. 

I’ve already walked away from 2 contracts during diligence. After prioritizing the issues the inspector found (focusing on safety / preventing further deterioration of the asset - setting aside cosmetics / comfort) and getting some pricing estimates on their fixes, I was unable to find a workable middle ground with the sellers on price cuts or credits. I changed my budget a bit, in hopes improving my prospect quality, and am currently under contract on a package of several properties that all have revealed similarly damning inspection reports. 

It’s clear that I will need to identify minimum quality standards that are different than my instinctive choices. Apparently it’s not uncommon to have a rental in Georgia with no heat. 

Among the perspectives that are on my mind as I proceed:

1. The tenants are clearly willing to or have no choice but to live in these conditions. They’re signing leases and paying rent. 
2. The inspector report seems reasonable when it says that raw sewage, collapsing foundations, and gas leaks are urgent priorities. 
3. Reviewing HUD and GA DCA checklists help me see what low income housing inspectors are looking at, but doesn’t shed much light on what passes and what fails. 
4. GCs, subs, and handymen seem like they only care what my standards are since I approve work and write checks. 
5. Federal and State code have opinions. As do ethical concerns, cost concerns, and market concerns. 

I realize that some of the answer is just about getting into an asset, making some decisions and seeing how it goes. I’m curious tho, how other cheap asset, low income investors are identifying what conditions are too wrecked to accept vs what they can tolerate, whether it’s for a little while or a long while.

How does it work for taxation if a tenant pays for, say a locksmith. Can I just charge them the normal rent minus the cost of the locksmith? This would lower my income for the month, but isn't it the same as writing off the cost of the locksmith? Obviously, I can only do one or the other not both.

What if a tenant decides to buy a new refrigerator? Can I charge him rent less the cost of the fridge?

I recently graduated from college with no debt. I have a decently well paying job, around 60k a year. I do have some side hustles where I make 750-800$ per week. (Both numbers pre tax) that projects my pre tax income to 96k. 
All my credit cards are paid off and I have only one car payment of 500$ a month. I currently rent for 800$ but it’s likely to increase once my lease expires.

I have come across a triplex unit for 380k that was freshly renovated, it has a 2 bed 1 bath unit (leased up to may 23) bringing in 1200$, another 2 bed 1 bath unit also bringing in 1200$ (leased upto may 22) and a 1 bed 1 bath bringing 900$ leased upto may 2022. 

I have 3.5% saved up for an FHA loan and I think this is a good opportunity to jump on, as the property is very cash flow positive, and I can occupy the 1 bed 1 bath unit and comfortably pay the monthly payments. 

I just very recently got my car, and now I feel like I am moving too fast. I also got my first credit card in July 2021, so my credit is fairly new, I have a score of 713. 
Would you advice me to take the deal? I was under the impression that lenders look for 2 years of work but my lender said that being a full time student is also a job. As long as I meet the debt to income ratio I should be fine.

I also want to stop the side hustle if I move into this apartment so I can study and upskill for a better w2 job.

Plan is to develop 93 acres (some of which is flood plain) into some large SFH lots and some smaller SFH lots. The land is in a good location (I live near the location). The group is raising capital for 35% of the purchase price and the investment is $95k and requesting only from a closed group of people. Return is 1 ready to build larger SFH lot + $10k in 18-24 months. Projected value of land is $180k which comes down to around 25% per year. I've vetted the investment group and they have done this multiple times before. So they are not really new to this. 

If any wise minds can share your thoughts on this kind of residential lot development deal, that would be great.

* 25% returns per year seems unrealistic (or at least not I am used to). Is this kind of return normal? 
* How easy it is to sell a single lot in the future?

I've stumbled upon DSCR loans while looking into other types of portfolio loans, and I have a couple of questions before I start calling lenders. 

Is it a requirement for a property to have a tenant in place for a DSCR loan? Or does the lender traditionally work off projected rent numbers?

Are they similar to conventional loans in that they approve you up to a certain ratio with X% down? Otherwise how is the turnaround time competitive with the current speed of turnaround on the market?

How much is personal credit score a factor? Are most lenders looking for a 680+ or are they flexible as long as the other numbers work out?

3502,rootcage,Is this a smart strategy for home ownership and investment?,"**Problem:**
Between my parents and I we pay ~$100k in rent per year living in the bay area (i live in an apartment in SF and parents in a SFH 3bd3bth), we'd like to put that money towards home equity instead.

**Background:**
I’m in my late 20s, single and no kids, work in tech and have enough saved up for 10-20% down payment for a $1M-2M home (which would be less than 25% of my networth). My parents also work in tech and currently pay ~$5k in rent, so they are able to continue paying at least that amount towards a mortgage if not more.

**My thoughts:**
I believe they’ll be the best tenants ever as they’ll take care of the place like it’s their own and we build equity towards the house together. I still plan to rent my own place in a city (either SF, LA, Austin, NYC or Miami). My intention is to move into this house in 5+ years as I start my own family.

**Misc:**
My parents and I are completely transparent about our finances and we essentially pool our assets together so there is no “I” but it is a “we” dynamic.
My parents already own multiple different properties around the world, so if need be they can sell one to clear out this loan if push comes to shove but our goal is to grow our family assets.

**Main question:**
If we find a suitable home for my parents to live in, does it make sense for me to pay the down payment and have my parents as tenants paying at least 70% of the mortgage?",realestateinvesting,1643745128

3505,Hiya_guys,How should my parent's use Real Estate to retire?,"I need some advice for my parents. They're 62 and 60 retiring very soon, maybe even before 65. They're considering using real estate to help deduct from their income on taxes to qualify for Medicare and Medicaid. Their combined income is 175000-200000 each year, they have a paid off house they live in worth 700000, and probably 250000 in ROTH IRA's and retirement accounts. That's it.  


They have never done real estate before, and are considering using it to decrease their income, but they have no idea how. How should they go about this? I've heard there was a way for one of them to make their full-time job managing rental properties, and the expenses from the rental property could be deducted against the other's full-time job. So if the expenses for a new kitchen on rental property could be deducted not only against the rental property's expenses, but also their partner's job's income. Does that sound familiar to anyone here?

3508,blinky626,Question on investment partnerships and how you deal with the tax man,"I want to preface with, I am super green but trying to educate myself before diving in to real estate investing. I apologize if these are stupid questions, bear with me. 

I want to get into rental real estate investing in the near future and one thing I haven't really heard/read/seen is once you set up a partnership, how do you deal with the tax side of things or the money distribution side. 

Just a couple examples:
For simplicity, lets say you are in a 50/50 partnership where both parties put in equal money and work, and both on the mortgage. Who gets to claim deductions on property taxes, depreciation, etc? Does each claim rental income on a 1099? Or is it better to create a business or LLC and become ""employees"" and get w2.

What if its a 50/50 partnership where one person puts in the cash (lets say down and closing), the other carries the risk (mortgage in their name) and does all the work. Would the cash partner only get the benefit in rental income whereas the mortgage holder gets the tax benefits of property ownership and also claim income from rentals?

Obviously there is also cash that isn't necessarily income but goes right back in for repairs. So how is that handled tax-wise? 
Obviously if you have a large real estate portfolio, you may have others figuring this out for you, but what about the small time investor who has only a couple properties? Or do you still just have someone else do all this for you?

I know I could probably talk to a tax pro on this but just wondering how others handle it since we don't hear much about the nitty gritty financial details of partnerships.",realestateinvesting,1643739820

First time house hacker here- submitted my first offer for a duplex in Southern NJ!

Quick question about my loan estimate from the lender - right now the taxes and homeowners insurance in escrow total $414 per month (purchase price $190k for context).

In running my numbers I want to be solid on this. From a tax standpoint, just looking at zillow as a point of reference the taxes in 2020 say $6,537 which would mean $544 per month.

Also the tax assessed value for 2020 was $137k.. and has been that way since 2014, at which point it was $154k, which I find interesting...

My questions are should I be preparing for a higher escrow monthly payment based on those numbers on the loan estimate, and should I be concerned with the tax assessed value of the home vs. the actual purchase price? Happy to provide more details.

3523,shadetreepolymath,"1033 exchange for new construction? Super complex, apparently, and I can't find an expert.","TLDR: My elderly parents want to conduct a 1033 exchange into a new construction project. This kind of transaction seems rare and complex, and I haven’t been able to find an expert to walk me through it.

(I've flaired this as 1031 exchange, because the 1033 is so similar to the 1031.  If the mods disagree, I'll remove the flair.)  

The county is purchasing a large property from my parents as part of an initiative to simultaneously improve flood control and expand their parks system. 

When they sell to the county, my parents want to conduct a 1033 exchange. For anyone not familiar with a 1033 exchange, it is very similar to the 1031 exchange. Both transactions allow a taxpayer to sell one piece of property, quickly buy another piece of property, and to defer any capital gains from the sale of the first property. The 1033 exchange differs from the 1031 in that the 1033 can only be used under certain circumstances (such as when a property is taken through eminent domain or under threat of eminent domain, as is the case with my parents’ property), the timeline to purchase the replacement property is much more relaxed (2-3 years for the 1033, 6 months for the 1031), and the 1033 does not require that the funds be held by a qualified intermediary like the 1031 does.

I met with a highly recommended 1031 qualified intermediary for guidance. She was nice and very knowledgeable (about the 1031), but she said that since this is a 1033 instead of a 1031, she would not be able to provide much guidance. I have read everything I can get my hands on to help my parents through this, but I still feel like there are a lot of unknowns.

I don’t know what sort of documentation is required to prove to the IRS that this sale is being conducted under the threat of eminent domain. In an effort to keep the transaction cordial, the county has carefully avoided words like “condemnation”. I’m afraid when it comes time to file taxes and claim the transaction as a 1033 exchange, the IRS may disallow it for lack of proof that there was threat of eminent domain.

I have found a few articles on using the 1031 for new construction, and all of them agree that it is a very complex process. In the process, as I understand it, the qualified intermediary contracts the construction, after which the taxpayer only takes possession of the property after the construction is completed. It is always emphasized that the taxpayer cannot take possession of the property before construction is complete. I have not found any articles about using a \***1033**\* (without a qualified intermediary) for new construction.

Now, the 1033 exchange does permit the funds to be temporarily placed into shorter-term investments while an individual is seeking a replacement property. So – Could my parents temporarily loan funds to an LLC, which then purchases land and performs construction, and then sells that completed project to my parents within the 2 year window?

I understand this is complex and I should probably be asking an accountant or tax attorney instead of Reddit. If I could find an accountant or tax attorney who is familiar with the process of performing new construction with a 1033 exchange, then I would go ask them these questions and go back to using Reddit for dancing cat videos, dad jokes, and history memes.

Is there a way to get landing on a flipped home’s ARV faster than waiting six months for seasoning to pass? It feels like my capital, or rather my lack of knowledge about lending services, is holding me back here and acting as a throttle on my “turnaround” time",realestateinvesting,1643694304

My fiancee and I want to house hack during our first year of marriage, but we're also thinking about taking a year to live in a travel travel trailer on the road. If we bought a duplex and rent out BOTH sides for the year, could we still claim it as our primary residence? The travel trailer would not have the proper amenities for it to be considered a home by the IRS (ie: permanent toilet facilities) if that makes a difference.

We're hoping to get a good primary-residence mortgage with a low down payment, so this would be helpful (while also giving us some cash flow while on the road).

Is this legal? Is it advisable? Is there way this can be done wisely? Any input you can offer would be appreciated! Thanks in advance!",realestateinvesting,1643690241

I bought my house last year; house hack, tenant paying about 50% of mortgage. I don't have much equity in the house and I have $50k in my pocket. If you were me, would you:

1. Spend the $50k of my cash on another bedroom/bathroom in the unit (based on a few estimates, a fair amount of work to be done) to raise the rental value of the unit and force appreciation, then do a HELOC or a cashout refinance (which I don't want to do since my interest rate is so low) to buy a next property.
2. Keep the unit as-is (it's pretty decent!), rent it out for 1bdrm prices around here, and use the $50k on a down payment for a new property.   

I'm leaning towards option 2 with the hopes that, if I get enough equity in the current house in next couple years, I can then take that money out to do the renovations, qualifying me for mortgage interest tax deduction. What would you do?",realestateinvesting,1643680472

1. Keep it as is, hope all is well

We had planned on getting a PM to deal with things at the time because of distance, etc. My biggest fear has always been not being able to lease it out and eating rent. The current PM company does a phenomenal job with getting tenants, they do charge 50% of the deposit but that's probably normal. 

They are AWFUL at the actual day-to-day management. In under 2 years, I've had:

* Tenant contacting me directly because they aren't making repairs for things like broken toilets.
* Blatant lying to tenants about improvements I never planned to make
* Acquiring new tenants without so much as discussing pricing or renewal
* Refusing to call/email me back for months on certain issues
* Unable to collect $900 in charges from previous tenant and leaving me on the hook
* etc.

Anyway, the list goes on and it's way more of a headache dealing with them than just doing it ourselves, especially for the fee they are charging. 

The current tenant's lease is up in July and they told us PM has already shown the house. PM says they have someone lined up but won't tell me if paperwork has been signed.

My wife and I are in a better position to potentially manage this ourselves but we clearly aren't realtors and don't live locally to show it. 

Could we just hire someone to lease it out and then turn it over to us to manage? If so how do I get out of the current agreement with my PM group? I'm guessing if they already signed paperwork with the new tenants to move in for July then I'm SOL for another year?

3582,existentialwanderer,Primary Residence - Rental Conversion,"Looking for some advice... in a bit of a complicated situation that I am struggling to determine how to proceed.

Here's some background. I purchased my first home in December 2019. It is fully owned by myself, and I am the only name on the mortgage. My parents offered to assist in the purchase of this home with the goal of turning it into a rental property that will benefit both of us after I move out. I paid the down payment, and they paid for some renovations, and they supplement my mortgage payment monthly. Next spring (2023) when I intend to move out, we will be 50%-50% equity partners in the property (meaning we will have both put the same amount of cash in the deal. Yes, we know I have received 100% of the tax benefits, and clearly live in the house, so we ""corrected"" for that by only counting a certain percentage of my monthly mortgage contribution as ""equity"").

This presents a few challenges.

1. When I move out, I do not intend to sell the house, and understand that getting a loan for a second property will be difficult without any months of proof of rental income. That said, the house is 3 blocks from the beach in a resort area, so I am confident we can rent for well above mortgage, or AirBnB for more than that. 
2. Assuming I can qualify for a loan for a new home, once I move out, all income for the rental property will initially be mine. However, as our agreement stands, half of that will be owed to my parents. Since I do not think that will be above the appx $15k gift tax exclusion, will I be able to just write my parents a quarterly check for their portion of the proceeds?

Using the home linked below as an example, could anyone tell me why this wouldn't be a good investment?

Assuming $900 gross rent but $600 NOI, cap rate ($7200 / $80000 = 9%) and cash on cash return seems ok.

Being that it's only $80K too, seems a 20% down would only require roughly $16K investment + closing costs.

Brewster, Yonkers, Union, Mount Vernon, Newburgh. Think I've watched every 'how to evaluate a multifamily' video on YouTube. However every house I find is a loss. Taxes, expenses and mortgage is killing me.  


Mortgages are $3200-$5300/mo

Expenses $1600/mo

Taxes $1200-$1600/mo

This means, an owner occupied 4 family needs at LEAST $6000 income just to cover costs. That means $2000/mo rents. You would need $333/mo profit per tenant, to make $1000/mo profit.

This means I need $1066 from 3 tenants to be FLAT. This means $1400/mo rents are needed to cover expenses and make $1000 profit. Top end of the scale above needs $6900/mo in rent, to be flat. That is 3 units paying $2300/mo. Then for that $1000 profit, you need them paying $2600/mo rents.

The detached garage is where the ADU would go. It’s a double wide garage and I’d of course do the work with permits to get it rented. 

I’m curious for people who have gone ahead with an ADU, what considerations did you make? Lessons learned? How was it building the ADU tenants in the main house? 


I do recognize that (maybe) unless the tenants move out the garage is included in their lease space and that can be problematic for getting this done. Ideally, I’d love to boot them, spruce up the house and raise its rent more and build out the garage into an ADU and rent that out.

Option 1 - Should I buy a two-family, keeping the three and renting out all units, while living in the two-family and renting out the other unit? Then in 3-5 years buy a single family. 

Option 2 - Or would I do just as well buying a single family next, keeping the three-family and renting out all units,  and then in 2-5 years buying another multi-family, could be anything from a two to a four family?

Didn’t mind since the property was in a nice location right on the border of a park (had young kids and a wife). We lived in the top flat and rented out the bottom two units.

Later in the year, Biggert-Waters passed and rate went up significantly - rate will eventually hit 6k annually. Currently paying 25% increase to the rate each year). 

Also Purchased a single fam in 2020 and now rent out all three units in the old property. PITI is $1575. Gross rent for all units total is $2850. Rents could be higher (probably could make an extra 300-500/month total), but I currently have great tenants so am comfortable with the current price. 

However, I also kind of want to list the property. Real estate is obviously hot just about everywhere. Property probably would sell for 275-300k if not in a flood zone. Comps are also hard to come by.

I’m really just here to get some thoughts/perspective. The properties cash flow and are really easy to find tenants. However, I’m worried about the resale value if I hold on to them with the flood insurance increases each year.

Our update made the interior nicer, but it could use a deep remodel in the bathroom, kitchen, and all flooring. At the moment my condo is worth roughly $200,000-250,000, rents for $1325 with great tenants (could rent for around $1500/month but I don't want to raise much on good tenants), HOA is $200/month (covers savings for future upgrades/repairs, building maintenance, landscaping, city fees, hot/cold water, building insurance, along with a few other things), and mortgage/taxes/insurance is $500/month. The condo location is very good and it really is a desirable unit. But the building was built in the early 70's.  


In our recent annual HOA meeting, we went over the budget and the reserve study. The years before I purchased my condo I am told the building had a different HOA that didn't manage it well, and the current HOA has been playing catch up. Based on the reserve study, we are going to be short on cash for future repairs/upgrades. We are currently putting in roughly $15,000 in savings and the reserve study recommends $30,000/year. A debate was had on whether to increase the HOA to $225 or $250 to help out; $225 won even though the numbers still put us below what the reserve study predicted would be needed.  


Later in the meeting, a discussion came up about the building pipes. Long story short, bottom units have been flooding because of old pipes.  My unit is a top unit and hasn't been affected at this point beyond occasional water shut offs. This lead to a discussion about needing to re-pipe the building, something that wasn't on the already too low budget and would be a massive expenditure.

   I am definately green as green can be in this realm.  

    I am in talks with a property owner as i am currently renting one of her rooms.  She wants to sell and move to arizona.  I would like the house...  to cash flow.long term hold. And leverage for more properties later on.  My credit isnt gonna get me a mortgage and time at workplace wont get me a mortgage either. 
  Was wondering the probabilities on possibilities on negotiating - having the owner utilize HELOC to 
Pay for move and tet into new home . While i would then manage this residence. Cash flow from the residence i am in would pay off the heloc.  After the HELoC was paid off i figured the lady and i would then keep the house in a trust and since im inevitably  holding to leverage to teach my little . I know the current owner also has kids in arizona ( why she wants to move there)  so i could also. ? Bring them into my plans? Or help them understand how to leverage? 

If the heloc wouldnt work i think i would have to go private funding and to that i am unsure of whom i would talk to and what numbers they use so i can even guesstimate if i could afford their terms since i would need atleast 8 yrs give or take to pay off a loan depending on the size of it and the rates

Ill pull the property card  info and clean up the info and post it once i get a real break from work.

Also i do have some assets ( small amount) that could be put on the table but i would like them to remain off the books....to strengthen my position. Is that ok to day?

As I look into the numbers, I’m just not quite sure that it’s a wise decision with how high prices are right now. I’m hoping to lay out our situation and get some input. 

We both just graduated college last year and now make around 105k gross between us. We currently rent a 2 bed/bath apartment for $1200/mo before utilities. We could liquidate our assets and have ~30k cash if needed, but would probably prefer to not sell all the investments we own. 

Our plan was to try to do an FHA 30 year loan so that we would have a lower down payment, but as I look into what that would have us paying each month, I question if home ownership is worth it at this point. To get a home that’s even barely bigger than our apartment in the area we live in would have us paying nearly $2500/mo including mortgage, taxes, fees, and PMI. With a lower down payment, my understanding is that a higher percentage of each payment would be going to interest as well. 

My goal is to stop flushing money down the toilet each month via renting, but looking at these numbers I question whether buying a home is accomplishing that. I worry I’d just get into a similarly sized home where I’d then have a lot more unexpected expenses, be paying more than double each month towards housing costs, and not building any more equity each month than I could just save/invest by continuing renting.

I need to replace 6 laundry machines at a building.

Local leasing company wants $1.10/day per machine, after that is met it's a 70/30 split, with 70 going to me. Machines will be credit card enabled too, so that's nice. All maintenance/service provided by them. 10 year lease/contract.

18 unit apartment building, average 1 load per person per week at $4 a load. $288 a month minus whatever utilities are to run the laundry.

Coin ops at Home Depot are about $1,000 a machine, $6,000 total.

I figure it would be about a 3 year payback. 

Only thing I'm unsure of is, maintenance.  How often are these things breaking down and what annual costs would I figure in for that?

3650,gamenglee,"Should I sell my rental property in Austin, TX?","I bought my house in 2013. In 2016 I relocated out of state for work, and have been renting my house out ever since. Even with a property manager sometimes I still get stressed being a landlord, so I've been considering selling the property.

Market value is around $550k, with a remaining loan of $60k. Monthly rent is $1800.

The appreciation has been great. I have positive cash flow, but I'm not leveraging my money much at all (disappointing with interest rates still relatively low), and that doesn't take into account vacancies or repairs (spent $15k on AC units a couple years ago!). I didn't increase rent last year in order to retain the current tenants. Also seems like the rental rates are lagging housing prices, so hopefully rent could be increased more in the future. 

The majority of my investments are in the stock market, so it's nice having this rental property to diversify. I thought about doing a 1031 exchange, but I'm not sure that would resolve any stress issues still being a landlord, so I'd probably end up just paying the capital gains tax and putting the money in the stock market. 

From other posts that I've read about properties in Austin, the market is expected to remain hot, and there is a resounding ""do not sell"". I'm just trying to convince myself whether or not that this is a good investment and it's worth the added stress.",realestateinvesting,1643554053

3686,tncivil2,Leveraging Career Experience in RE Investing?,"I’m a civil engineer in land development in Tennessee. I have 6-7 years experience with clients ranging from major universities, national multifamily developers, single-family builders, and beyond.

For those of you who are not in the development world, most real estate developers (90% or more in my experience) are MBA-types—financial experts only, and they do not have specialized knowledge about local Codes, zoning, infrastructure requirements, etc. That’s where we come in—we are hired as a third-party consultant to help assess all of these issues during the ‘due diligence’ period of their contract for a particular property. If the numbers pan out, we then obtain any required local approvals and prepare an engineered design which the developers construct, and sell/rent/operate for a profit.

Typically, developers have a very good idea of what it costs to build a building/home/whatever. The infrastructure costs, property entitlement issues, and other unknowns related to the property itself tend to be the make/break factors in whether a deal works or not. So our role is absolutely critical, and if we don’t do a good job, our clients can take a bath.

It has often surprised me how few of my fellow engineers take their expertise and try to leverage it to their advantage in real estate investments, even small ones. Part of the issue is that engineers in general, myself included, tend to be risk-averse and inside-the-box thinkers. Advising others on the viability of a real estate investment (which is effectively what we do) for a set fee is very stable and secure. But it’s not a great way to build real wealth.

I have often wanted to crack this nut, and find a way to move out of the consultant world and start making investments for myself, building on my own expertise in one way or another. But in our local RE market, even single-family home buyers are competing with all-cash offers from NY and CA transplants—let alone developable land of any size.

I’d love some thoughts on how to leverage my insider knowledge to my advantage in the RE investment world. Or, maybe someone to convince me that’s a fool’s errand.",realestateinvesting,1643490660

We came down for a couple weeks to check out the market, get more familiar with individual areas, etc..  We have been down here a number of times before.  For tax and diversification reasons, it makes sense for us to purchase something, even if we're not getting an excellent value on the purchase.  Our plan was to Airbnb the property (like everyone else).   If we simply break even, or even take a small loss, that's acceptable for us. Our budget is around $700K to $900K.

Here's how it went:

Home 1: Listed at 750K, good comp nearby at 850K in Jan of 2022.  It sold for 910K. 

Home 2: Listed at 875K, perfect comp, 1 block away, same builder, same square footage, same floor plan, same everything.  Sold for 770K 4 months ago.  They had offers of 910+ within hours of listing. 

Home 3: Listed at 650K, comps show it's probably worth 650K to 700K.  House was remodeled, but in our opinion it was a mediocre remodel.  Multiple offers at 750K, or $425/sq ft, when the home around it sold for $375/sq ft within the last 3 months. 

Home 4: Listed at $780K, overnight the price jumped to $850K, at the open house they mentioned multiple offers after they increased the price so it will go for $900+ if you want to bid. 

Admittedly we're looking at turn key homes that don't need much work.  However, we're consistently seeing prices that are 10% to 20% higher than comps from 1 to 3 months ago.

Even bidding $50K to $75K over ask, and over what comps say it's worth, hasn't mattered here.  This market just feels insane.  

Is anyone here investing in Scottsdale/Phoenix right now?  Even being aggressive and ""over paying"" our bids aren't even close to winning.

3703,zeusjts006,Looking for advice on buying 2 properties.,"So my wife and I bought a live in duplex in 2019. Our tenant pays a little more than half of the mortgage and we have nearly 2000 sq feet to ourselves. Minus a bat infestation, things have been going great.  (I'll come back to this)

My wife owns a salon and we have the opportunity to buy the mixed use building that the salon is in (a prime area and the landlord is willing to sell). It will cash flow immediately too. 

The salon's accountant recommends for us to buy the property under the business (for tax purposes). So we're going to put the down payment out of pocket.  But since the property is on a parcel with another building, it needs to be split. So that will take a few months to get everything in order. 

Meanwhile we also are looking to buy a vacation home/airbnb rental. 

Since the mixed use property is under the business, I'm assuming trying to buy both shouldn't be an issue since the mixed use isn't going by our personal credit but the salon's business history.  This is correct to assume? 

Like all property since we bought our duplex it's value jumped up like crazy.  I was wondering if I could take out 20k in a cash out refi and drop the pmi off at the same time. Even with the extra 20k, we still would be well over the 20% needed to drop off the pmi.

Obv don’t have the cash, but have you seen this before where sellers look for this? My mortgage broker says the house must need a huge repair and is likely no good. Should I steer clear? Any tips on what to look for during our viewing on Sunday?

Because of my current mortgage and a new born, I more than likely wouldn’t qualify for an investment mortgage.

Hey everyone. I am looking to buy my first property and im extremely nervous. It is now is almost **impossible to get breakeven cashflow (where I live)**,  not to mention positive. So I am looking at a place with decent  numbers  that I can force value appreciation through renos(BRRRR). This  kitchen  and that bathroom are tempting! Im planning on negotiating the  price  down aggressively (10%) and hope that makes up for my costs.

[Pics](https://imgur.com/a/Q3cbme7)

**Info:**

rented as is: -$550 (Id lose that amount, all costs included)

house: 1987

condo fees: \~150/months

HOA fund total: \~16k

8 mins walk from the metro station. Neighbourhood is decent and its close to a big park

Similar properties are priced higher according to my realtor

**Concerns:**

1. Sold   without guarantee of quality (maybe a Canada only thing). Basically the   previous owner died and his people made some renos and want to sell it   as is.
2. Interests   are rising soon and quick and easy appreciation time might have passed   and id have to sit on it for a couple of years to sell for profit
3. not   a lot of demand/offers on the apartment. My risk averse mind tells me   if there isnt, means its not as good a deal as it sounds

I could use some help from people who have some experience with renos, is this a dud? What do you think?",realestateinvesting,1643415058

3737,dirtbagdave76,Question about adjacent Land,"Bear with me on this one since I'm not a real estate genius and have to explain the situation.  If you want the short and skinny I tl'dr'd it at the end.  A friend of mine in her retirement phase recently purchased 40 acres of mountain with a bunch of abandoned trailers and assorted junk on it.  Thought it would be easy to clean and build a getaway on due to the beauty of the vistas (and it being part of a condor preserve.)  The deal was cheap because of all the abandoned junk she thought.  The price was a steal.  Previous owner had no bites and really was in a panic during signing (during first lockdown.)  We thought it was pandemic related and it but the plot thickened in the last year...  


We talked to the fire department because our gates were constantly being broken into, the locks we shared with the fire department.  That conversation lead to the discovery of the lien as well as the Hatfields vs McCoys type battle pre-dating us.  We found out their were liens on the illegal junk by the local fire department on the previous owner.  Luckily, the fire captain is being nice and not forcing us to pay right away but clean up is necessary.  


We also discovered other ""bug out"" type storage containers inside the mountain.  The last owner was a vietnam vet and managed to dig a bus underground with a very concealed entrance that was used as housing of some sort.  An entire bus.  


That's in addition to the other smaller storage container inside another part of the mountain (complete with wind-up tv's, rifles, and clothes), 2, count them TWO abandoned RVs from the 1970s filled with rotting crap, propane tanks and coyote poop.A nd a pretty decrepit chicken coop/tool storage container.    


The good news is all this junk can be removed according to quotes we received.  


The idea was to clean it up and rehab the land for either a community project.  However, it's come up that the adjacent land, also canyons and mountains riddled with junk and trailers, has been split into these tiny 10x10 lots and are been sold off to everyone from people in the state to various property trusts.  Even folks in Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.    


It's like someone came in with ruler and cut up the adjacent 40 acre block into these little rectangles and sold them all on a website or something.  However all of these lots are totally inaccessable and or literally slopes.  Some are just diagnol pieces of inaccessable rock.    There's no water or power on ours or their land.  However the only entrance is through our land -- which has a gated road we share with farmers.  This makes it hard to figure out who is clipping the gate.    


Tl;dr There are literally 30+ owners of those sliced up little pieces. Incidentally, we have been harangued by mysterious activities, like land being bulldozed in those areas that are messing up the terrain of our land and lots of evidence people are using our entrance to get to those areas.  Is there some scam going on with that land?",realestateinvesting,1643407864

Big questions-

Is it better to sell rentals with tenants or without? Need to decide soon on renewing the March lease. It seems I'd have more things to fix if selling empty.

I'd need no-income doc loans, would these DSCR loans be the way to go? I was thinking 30+% down? Trying to turn 250k properties into ~475k properties. 

    Rough math each property:
    250,000 sale
    -25,000 expenses (assuming 10% for agents/whatever)
    -1,500, 1031 costs
    -64,000 loan balance
    =159,000 as down payment
    33% down for 475k property.

3764,optimisticmillennial,BRRRR: How do you estimate rehab cost and know for sure it will get you to your ARV?,"In the BRRRR method, how do you know for sure that your rehab will get you to your ARV?

Do you just look at comps in the area and from that determine what type of rehab you need to make to get it to that level?

And better question, how do you estimate the cost of rehab to get it to the level of your comps?

It seems the goal is to find a distressed property in need of decent touch up and remodel, figure out ARV, and aim to buy it at 70% ARV less rehab costs. Essentially buying it at 70% ARV less rehab costs should generate a 30% margin after rehab, of which you would aim to tangibly get that 30% margin via cash out refinance to spend on the next property.

I manage the rental in exchange for living rent free in the ADU (I still pay my half of the mortgage) and the primary unit is rented out.

I am aware that you need 2 years tax returns and I was not making remotely close to what im making even last year so this is likely two years away.

Can you use future rental income in your DTI calculation? Will a bank even qualify me for a loan with little credit history 1.5-2 yrs (although it should continue to be perfect on time payments)?

3769,pointsb,Help Analyzing a 2 Family Deal,"I'm looking to start investing in real estate and have been lurking in this sub for a while. I have an opportunity that popped up and wanted to understand what blindspots I may be missing out on. I have a family member living in a home that the owner is looking to sell for approx 420k (40k over zestimate for what that's worth). He has been living on the property for 5+ years and typically handled a lot of the maintenance on the property and was compensated for it. It's a 2 family (3br 1.5b) in the NE area, an old, but more recent build in comparison to a lot of the other properties in the area and in a great school district. The mortgage is about 2400/month and prop taxes at about 7500. He's currently paying 1650/mo for the side he's living in and with minor renovations (appliances) to the kitchen on the other side, it can easily fetch 2000/mo in rent.

I have slightly above 200k in somewhat liquid funds between long term stocks, 401k and cash. The only concerns are 1. That it is about 1.5 hours from where I currently live, but I have family in this area and typically visit once a month. This is somewhat offset by the fact that my family member has already doing a lot of the maintenance on the property for a fee and is handy. 2. Is that I am currently searching for a business to purchase and I'm not sure how this would impact me in doing so, I would typically need about $100k on-hand to do so.

I would love any help with analyzing this deal and understanding if this is something you would consider for your first property. If anyone has any spreadsheets with breakdowns they would recommend using I would love to see them. With a basic one I found on youtube it's look like slightly under or at about a 7% cap rate.",realestateinvesting,1643352995

I believe the interest rates will rise over the next few months/years due to a couple reasons I won’t list to keep brief. I have the equity and credit to do so. I spoke with my banker today about it and he was strongly suggesting a HELOC instead. The fixed rates of a HEL seem way more appeasing even if the loan rate is slightly higher and more upfront costs. I would use about 15K for home renovations and the rest I’m between down payment for a rental or purchasing some land (very rural area where things are cheap).

For those who don’t know DCSR is a program for lending that specifies if the market rent is enough to cover the mortgage, taxes, and insurance, we can write a loan. Perfectly normal right? 

What I cannot believe is if the loan is 70% or lower of the appraised value, this requirement is effectively waived. You can rent out a place for $400 and get a loan for $2m on it with no income qualifications, given that the property is worth over $3m. The PITI could be tens of thousands of dollars a month, and if it is rented AT ALL you can get a loan under 70% with cashout.

3803,notsureifdying,Buying a house w/ mother in law in this market - did I do it right?,"Hey all, I know some of you have great experience in this area and this is my first home. 790k with a rentable basement apt. The area I'm in (SLC) is extremely competitive and ridiculously priced but also has a perpetual housing shortage and the youngest population with a huge influx of people coming in, so I'm hoping that I am making a good investment decision even though I would NOT be surprised if prices went down after interest rates go up.   


So 790k for my first home. I had enough saved for the 20% down payment, which allowed me to not pay PTI, at \~160k. I have about 65k left over for savings. Interest rate is 3.375% which makes this home about $3050/mo, which I can JUST barely afford with my 110k income and my GF's income. 

The only reason I went for this is due to the rentability of it. As I said, it has a basement 1bd/1bth, which goes for at least $1k/mo due to the really desirable location. Considering trying out short term renting it first because I've heard you can make more and if I get tired of that, we can switch to long term renter. I'm assuming 1k as a low end up short term renting could get more.  


So that lowers our general payment from 3k to 2k.   


Then the front portion of the house actually can be short term rented as well.  It's an interesting house format because there's a separate back entrance to a section of the house that has 3 bedrooms and 1 bath. My GF and I are thinking we'll sometimes rent the top floor 1 bd/ 1 bath with the kitchen and just live in the 3 bd / 1 bth in the rare times it's being short term rented, like 10 days / mo. It's a good amount of space and privacy. That alone would give us 1500/mo by our estimation. So this could either pay off the mortgage monthly while we live in it OR at least take a bit chunk away from the 3k. 

Obviously there are income taxes and depreciation deductable, which I looked into last night, seems like they generally cancel each other out. Any other things I really am missing here? I really could use some guidance because this is a BIG purchase.",realestateinvesting,1643312367

3835,GregariousDeviation,Interesting opportunity: need thoughts feedback.,"I found a nice home in a MCOL area. Its a good sq ft value in a solid location, but the real kicker is that it has a 1700sq ft ensuite downstairs with its own enterance, kitchen, bath, bed, living area, and driveway. Living area could easily be split into living and second bed.

So Id be upstairs with a 3bd 2.5 bath. Downstairs would be 1 or 2 bd apt. Zoning is a non-issue.

It comes with a warranty, HVAC and roof are 2020 and 2021 respectively.

My general gameplan is to Househack it as a two family unit:

Specs: $440,000
Down-Pmt - 5% or 22k
Mtg Amt: 418,000k at 3.437%
Monthly: ~2500 after PMI and Taxes

If I charge and can keep occupied the downstairs (I already have an applicatant I know and trust), and assuming no major repairs in the first few years (yes I know) then using an amoritization calculator Im figuring Ill have roughly 40k in Equity at 2/3 years while conservatively assuming NO appreciation (realistically, I expect it to slow, but not stop. My best research indicates 4.4% by this time next year, which would soften but not halt this market).

At this point I would Cash Out Refi a small amount and take any appreciation as well as all the cash I saved from the rental aspecr and just start BRRing the shit out of everything between 150-250k I can get my paws on. This is my 5 year plan, while simultaneously securing a home for myself.

I can cover the entire mortgage without any real undue burden in the event that it goes tenantless.

This seem like a solid plan? Thoughts? Just looking for a sanity check.",realestateinvesting,1643251911

We spend a lot of time in Mexico and absolutely love it there. Lately we’ve been talking about buying a vacation home and we’re considering property Mexico. Does anyone have advice on a house vs a condo in Mexico? We are looking at beachfront, and it seems like condo could be the way to go since it’s less maintenance. But does that mean one day the building could just be sold or torn down and we don’t own our condo anymore? I’m just unsure of the laws surrounding something like that in Mexico. 

Also, we want to spend max 550k so we’ve been looking in Yucatán and surrounding areas (sisal, chalem etc), Cabo, and sayulita. I’m personally leaning away from sayulita bc of what I’ve read about the cleanliness of the water/beach :( 

We just want to be close to a beautiful beach with clear water! Good restaurants would be nice but we’re okay with quiet sleepy towns. Also safety is a priority but we’ve never felt unsafe in Mexico so I’m not super worried about this. Also, how hard is it to buy in Mexico as a non resident?

3894,FaithlessnessLumpy16,Long Term Investment - Negative Cashflow,"My wife and I are currently looking at purchasing our first rental property, and I'm trying to make sense of the potential long term return to determine if the investment is worthwhile. I'm trying my best to do our due diligence on the numbers, but wanted to run this by others to see if this checks out and see if there's anything I'm missing.

The place we are looking at we can get for $515k. We'll be using a HELOC for the $100k down payment, and using about another $20-25k for some renovations on the house.

After calculating mortgage, interest on HELOC, insurance, tax, and ~$200 monthly for vacancy and maintenance, our cash flow each month is coming to about -$300. Everything I have read advises people to stay away from negative cashflow properties, and I understand the reasoning behind this. However, our goal is to use this as a long term equity build over (appreciation a bonus) 20+ years as opposed to monthly income. 

The total equity built in the first year comes in around $8500, while our out of pocket cash investment after year one comes out to about $3600, giving a +$4900 return year one. After 20 years, I calculated we would have invested about $72k and total equity built to be about $336k. 

To get to a point where we'd be close to breaking even each month, paying off our HELOC (3% interest rate) would be possible for us to pull off in maximum 5 years. Would you advise paying this off quickly to allow the property to break even each month, or is this extra money better served going into a diversified ETF where about 6-7% return could be expected long term? 

Do these numbers add up or have I missed a major factor in my considerations? Is this an investment worth following through on long term for the equity pay off in 20+ years?",realestateinvesting,1643170359

It's on a permanent foundation and is actually a pretty amazing little place. We went into this not planning for it to be an investment property. It was to be a family retreat that we occasionally rent out on Airbnb to cover the bills. Since that time I've jumped into the STR game with both feet.

* House built, land developed, house installed, etc over the next 18 months
* Closed on whole thing in 2021 for $170k total
* Current mortgage balance is $139k
* Have put probably $15k into it since closing

One of these houses sold 6 months ago for $350k. Another is listing this week for $395k. I could feasibly be walking away with $225k, which I would then reinvest into another STR.

Mom has a home that she can't afford to care for and refuses to move. This will be our only inheritance for my sisters (who need the money) and myself. I'm thinking about taking legal possession of it to repair it and make it worth selling when it's time. 

It needs a good bit of work (no heat/AC, electrical service upgrade, carpets, etc.) that she can't afford, so she's just a notch above living in squalor. 

She has no mortgage on the house. I figure if I can take possession of it, I can mortgage it to repair it, have her pay me something small in rent with an agreement (I want to help but don't want to get burnt as it isn't the best relationship), I can help her live comfortably and have something to split with my sisters when the time comes.

I recently got into contract on my first house hack. Seems like I'll be at $1550 per month Principal, taxes, and insurance. my loan does not require mortgage insurance. The property is currently fully rented for $2100. I ran some numbers and it looks like I should cash flow $232 with 8% CAPEX, 5% vacancy, and an extra $50 set aside.

I won't be using property management and if I remove the vacancy ( since it will be fully occupied ) I would cash flow $330.

If I'm only able to collect 1500 in total rent I should only be in the hole $300 a month which is supposedly okay for an owner-occupied house hack.

I'm kind of nervous so I'm hoping this works out. Does this look like a decent first deal to anyone? This property has appraised 71k since 2018 so I'm hoping to make some decent money on appraisal also in the future.

We have an offer from the owner for an amount we can stretch a tiny bit to afford but was higher than our initial ""max"" when we went into the negotiation process. The owner says he will list the house if we don't meet his price for a direct sale and we are concerned that in the current market and in the neighborhood we're in we'd get outbid by a wide margin if it hits the market. Is there any reason for us to pay to get an appraisal before the lender orders one? Would it be a waste of money just to satiate curiosity?

Curious if anyone has done something like this and what their experience was.

Some considerations:

* We bought our house fully furnished, and would be interested renting it out furnished, but not sure it that's a bad idea or not.  We don't care too much about any of the furnishings.
* Our house has a large chicken run and coop in the backyard.  Wonder if a property management company would help find someone who would want to take on these 5 egg laying chickens.  There's also a stray outdoor cat that has come to depend on us for feeding.
* We built a 16 foot yurt in the backyard.  It's in a grey area in terms of needing to be permitted, we didn't get it permitted.  I could take it down, but think it adds value to the property that could be attractive.
* I'm hoping to store some of our stuff in a locked shed outside the house, as well as in some locked lockers in the garage.  Would a property management company allow that? Everything I would store I would be okay with losing.

Does it seem wise to wait a few months so that housing prices will decrease since the interest rates have gone up? It seems right now that I'm getting the worst of both worlds. High prices and high interest rates. Your thoughts? Thank you!",realestateinvesting,1643138071
3937,vovr,Buying and managing rentals in other cities?,"I’d like to hear some opinions/advice from people who have rentals in other cities.

I want to buy real estate in a bigger city that’s around 6 hours away from me (1h if taking the plane).

I heard that your rental shouldn’t be farther away than 2-3 hours but I have no choice. Yields in my city are half.

1) how do you buy real estate if you don’t live in that city? Do you travel there every time you see something interesting?

2) how do you deal with handymen from distance? What about furnishing? Should a property manager deal with this?

3) how passive is this investment if using property managers? How to pick a good one?

4) How many times do you have to go and meet with the property manager?

5) do you think this is a bad idea and i should stick to my city and the lower yield?

There’s a house in my town that I’ve been watching for a while now. It has been vacant for a while and is not in the best condition. It seems pretty good for a fix, rent, and refinance deal (also maybe someone should talk me out of trying to do this for my first investment).

Anyways, it has never been up for sale. I used my county’s tax assessment website to find out who owns it. It’s an LLC but after a little investigating, I found out who the owner is, the email that’s tied to the LLC, and his Facebook. I found out that he lives a couple hours away, owns multiple vacant, distressed properties in the area, he’s originally from my town, and he is part of the same church I used to go to. I even recognize the last name. 

He is obviously quite wealthy, so there no way he can’t afford to fix up those properties. He’s in his late 60s so he probably has the time to and he isn’t open about his real estate investing so I’m assuming it’s probably not a big enough part of his life to worry about these properties anymore. It seems like he would probably be open to creative financing (I am thinking seller finance with a balloon payment after some time). 

Without being creepy, is there any way I should go about this? I know that skip tracing has its place in real estate investing but I’ve never done this before. Should I send an email to see if he’s even open to selling, or should I send a letter to his physical address? What would I even say?

I’m at a place in my life where I can be patient and let this pass or go all in and risk complete failure without stressing too much either way (young with few responsibilities), so I guess my first question is should I even start here?

These are tax advantages I'm aware of...

1. **Operating Expense Deductions**: You still pay income taxes on profits less depreciation
2. **Depreciation** is a delayed tax. If I want to take my money out of real estate and use it, it's taxed
3. **1031 Exchange**: Again, tax deferral. If I want to take my money out of real estate and use it, it's taxed
4. **QBI (Qualified Business Income)**: 20% income deduction. Probably the best example of the type of benefit I expect when I hear ""pay no tax""
5. **Opportunity Zones &amp; TIFs**: I recognize there may be local tax incentives that are less visible to common investors. Perhaps this is what more advanced investors/developers look for?

I have an opportunity to buy a rental property (single family home) in RI from a family member for $285,000 (rents for under market at $1500; market rent is more like $2000). The rough numbers seems to work out for me - neutral or slightly positive cash flow depending on down payment and loan rates - which I'm okay with. 

I'm trying to come up with the down payment. My mother-in-law is willing to lend/gift us $50k. From my initial conversation with a mortgage broker, I was told since this is a investment property, I can not use gifted money for the down payment. 

The mortgage broker recommended that I open a HELOC and use the HELOC money for the down payment. I then can use the $50k from my mother-in-law to pay off the HELOC. This sounds pretty good, but I'm not sure if there's a ""catch"" or something I'm missing.  


Is this ""normal""? Can I get a HELOC from one bank and shop around for the mortgage? Do I need to disclose that the down payment money will come from a HELOC? Not really sure how the debt to income ratio comes into play.
